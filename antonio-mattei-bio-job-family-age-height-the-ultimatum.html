As the reality show started, one person in every five different couples had been issued an ultimatum in their relationship. Antonio Mattei and <a href=#>Roxanne Kaiser</a> were one of these couples.</p><p style=text-align:left>In the rest of the writing, we shall explore what happened to them and discuss all about Antonio Mattei.</p><h3><strong>The Ultimatum Season 2: Are Antonio Mattei And Roxanne Kaiser Still Together?</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing, it was not understood if Antonio Mattei and Roxanne Kaiser managed to be still together. As of August 2023, Antonio‚Äôs relationship status on social media read simply ‚Äúsingle.‚Äù</p><p>Yet, on the show, people were told that the moment Antonio laid eyes on Roxanne, he knew that she was wife material. Roxanne too talked about feeling a strong connection. Nevertheless, the two did not go into a relationship until years later. They eventually reconnected over social media, and by this time they were both quite sure that they were meant for each other. So, they continued and when they chose to be on the Ultimatum&nbsp;show they had been together on and off for the past four years. And in their romance of theirs, at this time, it was Antonio who issued an ultimatum. He thought marriage to be the natural next step in their relationship. This was, on the other hand, the last thing on career-focused Roxanne‚Äôs mind. She instead wanted Antonio to match her income and business ambition.</p><p>Antonio, despite liking his partner‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit, wished that she would pay him more attention, particularly when it came to showing affection. So, Antonio thought of giving Roxanne the ultimatum, thinking ‚ÄúThat kind of pressure needs to be applied‚Äù for her to accept his proposal.</p><p>Antonio knew Roxanne was more than what people thought she was from the moment they first laid eyes on her and that she might be ‚Äúwife material‚Äù for him. But it wasn‚Äôt until years later when they finally met after a social media reunion that he got to express this clearly, only to discover their shared love wasn‚Äôt enough. Given that they had been on and off for four years, he also understood that they had their fair share of problems, but he still had faith that they could resolve them.</p><p>Antonio had no idea that, despite her acknowledged love and admiration for him, arranging a wedding was the furthest thing from this ambitious, career-focused 31-year-old‚Äôs mind. The main reason for this is that Roxanne had always envisioned having a life partner whose financial situation, business savvy, general ambitions, etc., matched hers, but he just fell short of all of her expectations. Additionally, there was the element of unadulterated respect; although the 30-year-old Freight Broker didn‚Äôt initially think so, several of their disagreements did suggest she believed she was superior to him.</p><p>However, Antonio made it clear that while he greatly respected her drive, he also expected her to take charge of their relationship by paying closer attention to him or speaking out about her feelings. He issued this ultimatum in the hopes that it would exert enough pressure on her to persuade her of the seriousness of both his proposal and the concept of marriage in general. He essentially wanted her to understand that, contrary to popular belief, her trial marriage to Alex Chapman had helped her maintain her freedom.</p><p>‚ÄúI love Antonio, but I had a lot of high expectations,‚Äù Roxanne conceded early on. ‚ÄúI want someone who works really hard and is ambitious, and that‚Äôs just not Antonio‚Ä¶ He knows I‚Äôm extremely, extremely career-focused; I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôd put marriage in the middle of things all going in the right direction.‚Äù But in the end, upon actively trying to build a career, he again asserted he‚Äôd be her champion if they tied the knot even though he knew it wouldn‚Äôt be exactly reciprocated. ‚ÄúI would always go above and beyond for you‚Ä¶,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúwaking up in the morning trying to do the right thing.‚Äù</p><p>As seen on social media, Antonio‚Äôs last post with Roxanne was almost a year ago.</p><p>Late in July 2023, when he was finally allowed to talk about Ultimatum, he took to the internet to invite people to see him on The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;find out if he got married or not.</p><h3><strong>Antonio Mattei Age</strong></h3><p>Because Mattei was born in 1992, he reached the age of 31 in 2023.
