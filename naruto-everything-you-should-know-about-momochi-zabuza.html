His arc has been adapted into a Light Novel</span></h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>The Land of Waves arc, the heroes’ first in-depth story after leaving the academy, is legendary for a variety of reasons. They eventually get a taste of true horror while on a mission when they unwittingly accept a task that is considerably more difficult than the task’s advertised difficulty.</p><p>Zabuza is one of the main reasons for this, as he poses a very real threat, even to the great Kakashi. This arc is so well received that it was adapted into a light novel in 2006, under the title “Innocent Heart, Demonic Blood”, probably in reference to Haku and Zabuza, respectively.</p><h3><span id=9_Zabuza_makes_a_brief_appearance_in_the_third_OVA_of_the_series>9. Zabuza makes a brief appearance in the third OVA of the series.</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1660492630_715_Naruto-Everything-you-should-know-about-Momochi-Zabuza.png><p>Released in Japan in 2004, Naruto: Konoha Party is the third OVA in the Naruto series.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-821 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 large-mobile-banner-2 large-mobile-banner-2821 adtester-container adtester-container-821" data-ez-name=animenewsandfacts_com-large-mobile-banner-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-animenewsandfacts_com-large-mobile-banner-2-0 ezaw=728 ezah=90 class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>Surprisingly, Zabuza and Haku make separate appearances throughout the oav. Haku can be seen in the men’s bathroom queue, while Zabuza is part of a team participating in the festival.</p><h3><span id=8_He_became_famous_after_he_joined_the_Anbu_and_killed_the_Jonin_of_Konoha_Kumade_Toriichi>8. He became famous after he joined the Anbu and killed the Jonin of Konoha Kumade Toriichi.</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1660492631_886_Naruto-Everything-you-should-know-about-Momochi-Zabuza.png><p>Before being conscripted himself, Zabuza made a name for himself among Mist Village residents by murdering more than a hundred academy pupils. This, however, is insufficient for Zabuza to begin acquiring national notoriety; this occurs instead once he joins the Anbu.</p><p>He takes the life of Konoha jonin Kumade Toriichi, who was a special kind of jonin, known as Tokubetsu, which means that he had very valuable skills in a specialized field. Zabuza then joined the <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-822 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Seven Legendary Swordsmen and his infamy only grew from there.</p><h3><span id=7_In_the_anime_he_and_Haku_witness_the_Kaguya_clan8217s_attack_on_Kiri_but_choose_not_to_help_them>7. In the anime, he and Haku witness the Kaguya clan’s attack on Kiri, but choose not to help them.</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1660492633_448_Naruto-Everything-you-should-know-about-Momochi-Zabuza.png><p>Zabuza and Haku are a bit more developed in the <a href=# data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=6 title=Anime rel="nofollow noopener">anime</a> than in the <a href=# data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=7 title=manga rel="nofollow noopener">manga</a>. This includes two extra scenes, one of which involves the Kaguya clan launching an attack on Kiri, his home.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-823 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-3 leader-3823 adtester-container adtester-container-823" data-ez-name=animenewsandfacts_com-leader-3><span id=div-gpt-ad-animenewsandfacts_com-leader-3-0 ezaw=250 ezah=250 class=ezoic-ad></span></span>In the end, he and Haku decide against aiding them, and even if their decision looks dubious, it’s difficult to hold them responsible. It’s not like Zabuza or Haku have any compelling motive to assist in the village’s defense as they have severe disagreements with the Mizukage’s leadership and are currently not linked with the community.</p><h3><span id=6_Zabuza_and_Haku_meet_Kimimaro_but_Zabuza_refuses_to_use_his_Kekkei_Genkai>6. Zabuza and Haku meet Kimimaro, but Zabuza refuses to use his Kekkei Genkai.</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1660492634_109_Naruto-Everything-you-should-know-about-Momochi-Zabuza.png><p>The second piece of additional development that Zabuza receives in the anime is a flashback in which he and Haku meet a lost young Kimimaro. He is incredibly similar to Haku in that he has nothing to live for, nowhere to go, and has an incredibly powerful bloodline.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-829 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-1 medrectangle-1829 adtester-container adtester-container-829" data-ez-name=animenewsandfacts_com-medrectangle-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-animenewsandfacts_com-medrectangle-1-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class=ezoic-ad></span><span class=reportline><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Punch-Man-Chapter-170-Release-Date-Time-Spoilers-Raw.png alt=Ezoic style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=ez-report-ad-button name="?pageview_id=10a70469-aafe-4cef-5488-6b9db3f8f025&ad_position_id=829&impression_group_id=animenewsandfacts_com-medrectangle-1/2022-08-14/6339733194837807&ad_size=300x250&domain_id=110275&url=https://animenewsandfacts.com/naruto-everything-you-should-know-about-momochi-zabuza/">report this ad</span></span></span></p><p>In spite of this, we witness Zabuza decline to accompany the youngster on their journey. This suggests that despite his seeming coldness, he truly cares for Haku and isn’t merely using him as a weapon to exploit the orphans’ loyalty and special power. If that weren’t the case, why not take a second one like Kimimaro?</p><h3><span id=5_He_works_under_Gato8217s_orders_as_a_mercenary_in_order_to_raise_the_necessary_funds_for_a_new_assassination_attempt_of_the_Mizukage>5.

However, after the failure of his attempt, Zabuza becomes much colder and more bitter, content to be hired by anyone corrupt enough that they are willing to pay, rather than following his own convictions.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-837 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many of his former followers eventually leave him.</p><h3><span id=3_The_truth_about_Haku8217s_importance_to_Zabuza_does_not_hit_him_until_after_the_latter8217s_death>3.
