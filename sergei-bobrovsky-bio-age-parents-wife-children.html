He is a two-time recipient of the prestigious Vezina Trophy, earning the honor in the 2012-13 and 2016-17 seasons while playing for the Blue Jackets.</p><p>In a significant move, on July 1, 2019, Bobrovsky signed a seven-year, $70 million contract with the Florida Panthers, solidifying his position as their starting goaltender. On February 10, 2020, he reached a milestone by playing his 500th NHL game, although the Panthers suffered a 4-1 defeat against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p><p>During the 2019-20 regular season, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bobrovsky</a> faced challenges, posting a record of 23-16-9 in 50 games before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the league to pause. His goals against average (GAA) of 3.23 and save percentage of .900 were his poorest since the 2011-12 season, his last year prior to joining the Blue Jackets. In the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs qualifying round against the New York Islanders, Bobrovsky started all four games but conceded 12 goals as the Panthers lost the series 3-1.</p><p>Bobrovsky’s international career has seen him represent Russia in various tournaments. In 2007, he played a prominent role in the Super Series, an eight-game series between Canadian and Russian juniors, where he logged the most ice time among goaltenders. The following year, he backstopped Russia to a bronze medal in the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.</p><p>Selected as one of Russia’s goaltenders for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Bobrovsky shared goaltending duties with Semyon Varlamov. However, the Russian team suffered a shootout loss to the United States and were ultimately eliminated from the tournament by Finland with a 3-1 defeat, with Bobrovsky making an appearance after Varlamov was replaced during the game.</p><p>Bobrovsky continued his international success by participating in the 2014 IIHF World Championship in Belarus as Russia’s starting goaltender. He delivered an outstanding performance in his first game, saving all 27 shots to secure a shutout victory of 5-0 against Switzerland. In the gold medal game, Bobrovsky faced off against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators and helped Russia secure a 5-2 victory, earning the team its second gold medal in three years at the tournament.</p><p>In the 2015 IIHF World Championship, Bobrovsky was named the starting goaltender for Team Russia. He showcased his skills with impressive saves, including stopping a penalty shot against Belarus in the group stage, and led his team to a 4-0 win in the semifinals against the United States. However, Russia fell short in the final, losing 6-1 to Canada despite Bobrovsky’s notable saves.</p><p>Outside of hockey, Bobrovsky has shown his generosity and support for others. On March 13, 2020, amidst the suspension of the 2019-20 NHL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he pledged to donate $100,000 to assist the part-time workers of the BB&T Center who were unable to work during the hiatus. This gesture demonstrated his commitment to making a positive impact off the ice as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sergei Bobrovsky Age</h2><p>As of 2022, he was 34 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sergei Bobrovsky Parents</h2><p>His parents are Andrey Bobrovsky and Larisa Bobrovskaya.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sergei Bobrovsky Wife</h2><p>He is married to Olga Bobrovskaya.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sergei Bobrovsky Children</h2><p>Details about his children are not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sergei Bobrovsky Net Worth</h2><p>Sergei Bobrovsky’s net worth is estimated to be around $30 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqycq5%2BVnnqju8Grpq%2Brm656o7XOZpignV2lrrOxza2qZq%2BZm7Jur8eio52qlaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
