However, her current husband, Pastor Keion Henderson, had a relatively more eventful weekend. In fact, pastor Keion was out there changing lives through his widely popular Cry-out conference.</p><p>The much-anticipated Cry Out conference hosted by Henderson and other big names finally came to an end after a successful run. Apart from the noble initiative to emotionally and spiritually uplift people, the conference also changed a girl’s life in a major way.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Pastor Keion Henderson dished out saving grace and…Cars?</h2><p>Over the weekend, the Cry-Out Conference held in the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston was in full swing. The conference, a brainchild of Pastor Keion Henderson, created a major frenzy on social media with a viral clip. One of the event’s biggest highlights was when Henderson seemingly dished out a saving grace to a girl, which left her in tears.</p><p>&nbsp;The Houston Pastor shared the emotional moment <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>with his 1 million followers on his Instagram</a>. Incidentally, the girl in question is a struggling college student who had spent the last $112 of her savings. Consequently, Henderson called her near the stage and handed her a fat bundle of notes worth ‘much more than $112’, as the pastor jokingly said. Then he surprised her with another shocking reveal. Henderson called her on the stage this time, pointed to her, and exclaimed, “You have a car now.” The whole incident brought the college student to tears.</p><p>He then harped on how he got the car in his hands, the car being a 2018 Chevrolet Cruze. Following Henderson’s saving grace, people in the audience also donated generous amounts to the girl. The whole atmosphere in the arena exuded positive energy as the Houston pastor changed lives with unparalleled enthusiasm.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nba-basketball-news-now-married-to-a-pastor-shaquille-oneals-ex-wife-shaunie-welcomes-millionaire-sons-and-daughter-for-spiritual-conference?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-984749316-399x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Now Married to a Pastor, Shaquille O’Neal’s Ex-Wife Shaunie Welcomes Millionaire Sons and Daughter for Spiritual Conference</p></a><p>The clip of the emotional moment went viral on social media, with many lauding Henderson’s noble efforts.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Who is Keion Henderson?</h2><p>Keion Henderson is the Founder, CEO, and Senior Pastor of The Lighthouse Church & Ministries, a church community headquartered in Houston, Texas.
