He was so intrigued by the model that he posted a letter to the car company asking for a job, to which Porsche actually replied requesting him to complete his schooling before applying at their offices.</p><p>Although, before completing school, the punk artist in him was awakened due to which he dropped out of school in 1982 and associated himself with heavy metal and punk rock bands instead. For quite some time, he struggled to gain a strong foothold, frequently switching residences and jobs to sustain himself while following his heart. Magnus Walker eventually decided to immigrate to the US when his future endeavors became hazy in England.</p><p>He first started with a summer job in Detroit, but then moved on to Los Angeles. There he entered the world of style business on an accidental note, as he was approached by the Faster Pussycat’s (a glam metal band) Taime Downe, who after encountering Magnus’ handiwork of customization on a pair of pants was so impressed by it that he went on to buy eight customized pairs from Magnus, each for $25.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>When his business grew multiple folds in the future, he married Karen Ann Caid.

The response to his designs was humongous, and by the 90s, his brand named ‘Serious Clothing’ was worth millions.</p><p>With the expansion of his business, Magnus was finally able to buy his dream car, a 1974 model of Porsche 911, in the year 1992.
