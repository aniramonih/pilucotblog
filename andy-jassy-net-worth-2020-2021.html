If you don’t know and are eager to learn about them, join me as we explore the life of one the leaders and the great minds behind these great organizations, Andrew R. Jassy (famously known as Andy Jassy).</p><p>Andy is an American-born businessman, as well as the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you don’t know about it, Amazon’s cloud computing business. Jassy is also one of the minority owners of the upcoming National Hockey League team in Seattle.</p><p>Maybe you know about Andy Jassy very well, but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Andy Jassy’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Andrew R. Jassy was Margery together with Everett L. Jassy of Scarsdale in New York. His father was one of the senior partners in the corporate law firm by the name Dewey Ballantine in New York as well as the chairman of the firm’s management committee. His birth dates are said to be between 1967 and 1968.</p><p>Jassy grew up in Scarsdale, a place which is in the suburbs of New York. He got educated at Scarsdale High School, where he graduated in 1986. Jassy earned a bachelor’s degree from Harvard College and was the advertising manager of <i>The Harvard Crimson. </i>He later achieved an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Andy Jassy, just like many wealthy persons, has managed to keep his personal information away from the public. He has even managed to keep his actual birth date away from the public eye. In 1997, Jassy tied the knot with Elana Rochelle Caplan. She was the daughter of Louise and George Caplan, hailing from Beverly Hills, California. The wedding took place in Santa Monica. Their wedding was officiated with the bride’s cousin, Rabbi James Brandt, at Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. Information about his children is not yet revealed.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 1967\1968, Andy Jassy is 54 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height and weight are not revealed to the general public.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>In 1997, Andy joined Amazon, about three years after its founding. Jassy was one who championed the formation of Amazon Web Services, in 2003, with a team of 57 other people. By then, he played a role somewhere between the technical assistant and the chief of staff.</p><p>He ensured that AWS solved a problem for Amazon’s software engineers. Before that, the engineers were spending too much time figuring out the computing infrastructure for each new project. Consequently, he earned a promotion from senior vice president to CEO of AWS in April 2016, Jassy heads AWS, and one of his tasks is to maintain the open-mindedness that enabled Amazon to say yes to AWS those years ago.</p><p>When AWS saw the light of the day, it was not apparent that it would boom. To begin with, it made a proposal of a radical idea that would allow any programmer the ability to rent computing power whenever needed as long as he or she has an Amazon account. Previously, most companies not only bought but also ran their servers.</p><p>After launching its first service, AWS grew up alongside many of today’s most prominent start-ups. Its existence has enabled many companies to operate cheaply and scale quickly because they no longer had to buy expensive servers. AWS’s turning point came in 2012 when it won a contract with the CIA. Under Jassy’s leadership, AWS has become the most significant technology infrastructure provider in the world. It is also the fastest growing and most profitable part of Amazon.</p><p>Jassy says that he joined Amazon because it had ambitions more than a bookseller. Today Jassy comes across as a dyed-in-in-the-wool Amazonian and often reaches for a company slogan to illustrate a point. He is a firm believer in the Amazon principle of ‘having a backbone’ and says it is vital for employees to respectfully challenge each other.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Andy has achieved a lot since joining Amazon, and he is assured of making more success if he continues with the determination he got in his work.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Andy Jassy in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Andy-Jassy-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The estimated net worth of Mr. Andrew R. Jassy is at least $300 million as of July 2024. He owns over 6,945 units of Amazon.com stock worth over $218,914,062, and the last 13 years, he sold AMZN stock worth over $70,327,147. Also, he makes $348,809 as Chief Executive Officer of Amazon Web Services at Amazon.com.</p><p>The most significant trade he’s ever made was selling 14,000 units of Amazon.com stock on September 22, 2016. The units sold worth $11200000. On average, Andrew trades about 4,111 units every 42 days since 2006. As of current date format, he still owns 93105 units of Amazon.com stock.</p><p>Jassy’s story is one that, when to read and followed carefully, has a lot to learn from. One of the things learned is that one should never fear speaking out their mind. If he feared speaking out his thought when AWS was formed, he would not have managed to be the CEO of his idea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZK6vsNhmoZqro656r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8kWlka2hiZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
