Speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impaulsive</a>, Paul shared his thoughts on Bad Bunny’s involvement with WWE.</p><p>“It’s hard, though. I think cajones is the right word,” Paul said. “Not a lot of people can do that. The difference [between us] is this, though. This is what I say to people who are trying to compare me and Bad Bunny in WWE. I wrestled in high school. I did sports and athletics. I am a YouTuber, but I’m an athlete. I was an athlete first, I always have been.</p><p>“I didn’t box before, but I wrestled. I can still surprise people because I’m a YouTuber first, but I was an athlete first. Bunny is a musician, dude. He has no business being as good as he is. He comes in there and he crushes it.”</p><p>Nick Khan previously discussed how Paul and Bad Bunny started working with WWE.
