Mel had just graduated in October 2023, and she was in the midst of her second year of duty when the unfortunate event occurred. When Mel was working at the Regional Jail, his coworkers remember him as a shining example of professionalism and cheerfulness.</p><p>A fellow officer made the following observation about her: “She was always happy, she truly enjoyed her job, and even though she was still kind of new, I could always trust her to train the new officers in the right way.” It was impossible to find a single moment in which she did not have a smile on her face. To put it simply, she was the finest. Mel’s dedication to her position as a correctional officer made an indelible mark not just on her fellow officers but also on the convicts she was responsible for serving. Everyone who worked in the New River Valley Regional Jail admired and respected her because of her contagious energy and her unwavering commitment to her assignment.</p><p>During this trying time, we want to let Officer Wohlford’s family and her extended work family at the Regional Jail know that our thoughts and prayers are with them. Additionally, we would want to convey our sincere condolences and extend our most sincere thanks for her service. The legacy of quality and compassion that Melinda Wohlford left behind will continue to inspire those who had the opportunity of working alongside her. Melinda Wohlford will be sorely missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKWVobavsMBmrqignJu8s7CMqJmirKWWv7p5zZ6uZqqZq7KzedWao6WdqWK%2FprPIqKWapF2frqq4jK%2Bgq5%2BZo7aiecyeo6KmlJZ6uLvHpZ2oqpRitaK%2FjJ2gnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
