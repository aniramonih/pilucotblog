Edelstein added, “It’s been four weeks, and we reached $1.3 million in sales. Because we had so many sales, we are back-ordered, and we have about 50,000 orders to get out.”</p><p>In the clip, Corcoran met with the duo and told them to find new facilities. “The moment you were on Shark Tank, you outgrew this copacker,” she said. “You need a second copacker, two labelers. You need two of everything because you can’t rely on only one supplier.
