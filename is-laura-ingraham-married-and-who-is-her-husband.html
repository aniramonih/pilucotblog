She was previously in a committed relationship with a successful businessman by the name of James V Reyes. The two were so dedicated to one another that they became engaged in the year 2005, eagerly anticipating their future together as husband and wife.</p><p>Soon after, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which derailed their wedding plan as they, instead, focused on helping her get well. It was a particularly trying time for Laura as she had to face the harsh reality of her illness head-on. She underwent surgery on April 26th, 2005, and eventually beat the disease.</p><p>However, her relationship with Reyes did not survive because they called off the engagement.
