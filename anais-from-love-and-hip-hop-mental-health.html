In the lengthy caption, Anais shared that she no longer cares about the opinions of others.</p><p>“OK, I’m way too skinny,” Anais wrote. “That’s your opinion, and it should be respected. Back then, I used to care about your opinions to be my inspiration. Now y’all became part of my expectations … so that’s second. Sorry, I’m putting myself first. No more caring about what others think of me, especially when their state of mind is real f--ked up ... as long as I’m healthy and my spirit is with God or whoever is ever higher than myself, since they have lied so much.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Fans shared that they were not trying to disrespect Anais, but they’re simply concerned about her well-being.</p><p>“I know a lot of people on here come at you the wrong way and that’s why you are so defensive. But, there are also people that are really worried, and aren't pointing to the drastic weight loss to hurt your feelings, but because they care. You are beautiful and valuable. Take care of yourself. Tu eres bella, but right now you look really unhealthy. You are strong, you can do this!” one fan commented.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anais spoke about her mental health struggles and her weight loss in January 2019.</h2><p>In a January 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch Weekly</a>, Anais shared that she was dealing with a lot throughout the course of filming L&HHNY — including being hospitalized in a mental facility after having an argument with her husband, Reuben Martinez.</p><p>Although Reuben insisted that Anais was not in need of any medical attention, the authorities kept her hospitalized.</p><p>“They stopped my husband from seeing me, they didn’t allow my family, nobody," Anais told the outlet. "And they even threatened me with taking my kids away. They even opened a case, an investigation to take my children away while I was in the mental facility. I got dumped there, I was under medication, hallucinating, and all this concerned my husband."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Anais also shared that her past gastric sleeve surgery has impacted her weight, but she’s thankful for all the support.</p><p>“I wanna really thank [my fans] a lot, and I’m doing fine,” Anais told the publication at the time. “I know they also talk about my weight loss, they’re concerned about that. I was just going through a lot at that time, not eating much, working, and filming. So, I blame it on that. But I am totally fine, taking care of my family, and I thank everybody for their support.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During Anais’ time on L&HHNY, she revealed that she was frequently hospitalized in mental health facilities.
