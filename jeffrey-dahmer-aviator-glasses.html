The thin wire-framed eyeglasses, complemented with dark lenses, have become a trendy sunny day staple because as Twitter user <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">@krysilove</a> put it in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, "Aviator glasses really look good on everyone. That's a superior shape."</p><p>When it comes to aviator frames paired with clear lenses, the popularity goes down. It's as if when the glasses have prescription lenses in them for everyday use, they're just not as cool. And while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner</a> have been spotted donning them, it's clear they were only worn to make a fashion statement.</p><p>Other public figures with aviator glasses include ... umm ... <a href=#>Jon Heder</a> in the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite ... and (*checks notes) notorious serial killer <a href=#>Jeffrey Dahmer</a>!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Warby Parker</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There's a lot of talk about Jeffrey Dahmer's aviator glasses.</h2><p>For years, Jeffrey Dahmer's aviator glasses have been a hot subject on Twitter. And now that <a href=#>Netflix's</a> latest biopic series <a href=# style=text-align:start>Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story</a> has been released, the talk is starting up again.</p><p>People are obsessed with Dahmer's aviator glasses, despite the fact that he is definitely not the first person to wear them. Nonetheless, aviators have become synonymous with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Dahmer glasses</a> across social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this new jeffrey dahmer show is terrible PR for me wearing aviators</p>— chris (@chrisclairr) <a href=#>September 26, 2022</a></figure><p>But while Dahmer is most commonly associated with specs, he's just one of a handful of serial killers who wore aviators or aviator-adjacent glasses. Historically, there has been somewhat of a correlation linking these glasses to those who ruthlessly murder. In fact, people have even teased this phenomenon on social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nah but why all the serial killers back in the day used to be wearing the same clear aviators</p>— juicy fruit (@jewelnotsantana) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p>In addition to Dahmer, <a href=#>Dennis Rader</a> (the BTK Strangler), who killed 10 people in Kansas from 1974 to 1991, also had a pair of similar clear-lens glasses.</p><p>California-based serial killer <a href=#>Ed Kemper</a> also wore similar eyewear, as he savagely took the lives of six college students, his own mother, and her best friend in the early '70s.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Gregg Henry as Dennis Rader in the Netflix series 'Mindhunter.'</p></figure><p>Furthermore, although female serial killer <a href=#>Dorothea Puente</a> didn't have aviators per se, she did don a similar pair of oversized glasses, but with thicker frames.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=#>Zodiac Killer</a>, who is believed to be <a href=#>Gary Francis Poste</a>, was also depicted having large lens glasses in the police sketch that was drawn of him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Dorothea Puente in Netflix's docuseries 'Worst Roommate Ever'</p></figure><p>Now — just to set the record straight — in no way am I implying that people who wear aviator glasses are serial killers. But the sameness of these killers' eyewear is definitely interesting.</p><p>So, why would they all choose similar glasses? While it could just be an eerie coincidence, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">research shows</a> that people who wear glasses are generally seen as more attractive and trustworthy — which, come to think of it, might help serial killers lure their victims.</p><p>Furthermore, former lawyer Harvey Slovis told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethics Alarm</a> that glasses are part of what has been dubbed the "nerd defense" in court. And more often than not, clients who wore glasses and dressed well were acquitted, despite the evidence against them.</p><p>He explains, “Glasses soften [suspects] appearance so that they don’t look capable of committing a violent crime." Perhaps that was what Dahmer was thinking too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnstGesGackZ26pr6Mmq2imaSkv26zy5qqrJ2j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
