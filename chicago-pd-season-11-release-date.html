There’s a lot she still has to confront in herself and doesn’t necessarily know how to do so."</p><p><h6 class="mb-xs text-left heading-6">More like this</h6></p><p>Chicago PD has been running since 2014 and has proven popular ever since, following the officers in the Intelligence Unit of the 21st District of the Chicago police department.</p><p>Jason Beghe stars as Hank Voight, the leader of the Intelligence Unit – a character that was first introduced as something of a dirty cop in Chicago Fire – and remains the one constant as officers leave and others join the team who pursue some of the city’s major criminals.</p><p>Read on for everything you need to know about Chicago PD season 11.</p><p class="newsletter-sign-up__disclaimer body-copy-small">By entering your details, you are agreeing to our <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>terms and conditions</a> and <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>privacy policy</a>.

As of now, there has been <strong>no confirmation on a UK release date</strong> but we do know that the series will likely be available to watch on Sky Witness and NOW, as per previous seasons.</p><h2 id=chicago-pd-season-11-cast-whos-returning-eaa902d4><strong>Chicago PD season 11 cast: Who’s returning?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2023/10/ChicagoPD-season11-cast-2-6bfe4c9.jpg><p>Of course, the big news going into season 11 is that Tracy Spiridakos will be exiting the series as Hailey Upton Halstead, but there's been no word yet as to when exactly that departure will come in the series.</p><p>Upton will be struggling with the departure of her husband Detective Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) who resigned from the force in season 10 to return to the army, so it is unlikely he’ll also be seen in the new season.</p><p>One character's life that hangs in the balance going into the new season is also Patrick Flueger's Adam Ruzek, after that shock season 10 finale saw his fate hanging in the balance.</p><p>The cast of Chicago PD that we'd expect to be returning for season 11 is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Jason Beghe as Detective Sergeant Hank Voight</strong></li><li><strong>LaRoyce Hawkins as Kevin Atwater</strong></li><li><strong>Marina Squerciati as Kim Burgess</strong></li><li><strong>Benjamin Levy Aguilar as Dante Torres</strong></li><li><strong>Amy Morton as Trudy Platt</strong></li><li><strong>Patrick John Flueger as Adam Ruzek</strong></li><li><strong>Tracy Spiridakos as Hailey Upton Halstead</strong></li></ul><h2 id=chicago-pd-season-11-plot-what-will-happen-9385c7af><strong>Chicago PD season 11 plot: What will happen?</strong></h2><p>The finale of season 10 continued the investigation into white supremacist Richard Beck, and led to Adam Ruzek – who had been determined to protect Beck’s daughter Sam and grandson Callum – being betrayed and shot by Callum.</p><p>While we last saw Ruzek being taken to Chicago Med in an unknown condition, photos from the set of Ruzek in a hospital bed – presumably from the next season – would indicate he survives.</p><p>That’s good news, as one of the other plot lines waiting to be resolved is Ruzek’s relationship with Kim Burgess. They were engaged, then broke up and dated other people, but rekindled their romance in season 10 and could potentially (finally!) walk down the aisle in the new season.</p><p>However, the Beck storyline could mean more trouble for the couple before they get their happy ending. In the season 10 finale, Richard Beck is killed by the team as they try to capture him, but there’s always the possibility that young grandson Callum, who clearly worshipped his granddad, could seek revenge and be a potential threat in the future.</p><p>We do know that the new series is set to open with plenty of drama with the premiere episode, entitled Unpacking, seeing Upton tasked with shadowing a crisis prevention team, where she finds her “approach to policing at odds with the team’s mental health clinician,” according to the episode’s synopsis. The case will bring out Upton’s “personal struggles,” with Voight helping her through it.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-chicago-pd-season-11-trailer-be10b8e8><strong>Is there a </strong><strong>Chicago PD season 11 trailer?</strong></h2><p>There isn’t a solo Chicago PD season 11 trailer but there is a One Chicago trailer, which gives us a glimpse of a struggling Ruzek post-shooting and some of the other beloved PD characters amid shots of Chicago Fire and Med.</p><p>You can watch the trailer below.</p><p><strong>Chicago PD is available to watch on Sky Witness and NOW in the UK. <a href=# rel=sponsored>Sign up for Sky TV here</a>. </strong><strong>For more news, interviews and features, visit our </strong><a href=#><strong>Drama</strong></a><strong> hub, or find something to watch now with our </strong><a href=#><strong>TV Guide</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=#><strong>Streaming Guide</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Try Radio Times magazine today and get 10 issues for only £10 – </strong><a href=#><strong>subscribe now</strong></a><strong>.
