That doesn’t mean fans are flocking to the box office.</p><p>We previously reported that AEW is trying hard to avoid a bad turnout at Arthur Ashe Stadium. <a href=#>They are running BOGO deals on tickets </a>currently being sold. That has helped some, but it hasn’t been significant.</p><p>Are this point, they still have a lot of tickets to sell. They have over 4,000 tickets that still need to be sold for the event.</p><p>AEW Dynamite / Rampage Wed • Sep 20 • 7:30 PM Arthur Ashe Stadium, Flushing, NY Available Tickets => 4,145 Current Setup => 11,638 Tickets Distributed => 7,493 (+465 since last update 3 days ago)</p><p>We will have to see if AEW can get a packed house in Arthur Ashe Stadium. At this point, it appears that they have a lot of work to do. Tony Khan still has a few more matches to book for the show, but it might not be enough to bring in 4,000 more fans.</p><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more on this story, and so many more. AEW is going to keep holding big events, but it’s hard to argue that their momentum is still the same as it was in 2020.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on AEW’s Grand Slam booking?
