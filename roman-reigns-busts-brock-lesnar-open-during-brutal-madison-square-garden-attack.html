He returned as the Tribal Chief and&nbsp;<a href=#>truly reinvented himself</a>. The change was several years in the making&nbsp;<a href=#>as fans wanted it for so long</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Head of the Table has certainly been very dominant as the WWE Universal Champion as he has remained the champion for well over a year now. It is unlikely he will be losing the title anytime soon from the looks of it. He has competed against several top WWE Superstars throughout that time.</p><p>During WWE’s live event at Madison Square Garden, Brock Lesnar defended his WWE Championship against Austin Theory. This certainly <a href=#>upset fans who wanted Bobby Lashley to compete instead.</a></p><p>After Lesnar won the match, Roman Reigns and The Usos came out and attacked Brock Lesnar. While Lesnar managed to turn the tides, Paul Heyman’s distraction helped Reigns and the Usos gain the advantage again.</p><p>They all brutally attacked Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns even busted open The Beast Incarnate with several chair shots and then with the steel steps. Reigns then held both the Universal and WWE Championship as he stood tall over Lesnar.</p><p>We will have to wait and see what Brock Lesnar will do next as he will certainly want some measure of payback after Roman Reigns busted him open, ahead of their WrestleMania 38 match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
