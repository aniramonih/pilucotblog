Before <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> plucked the "Sign of the Times" singer from "The X Factor" auditions, he worked at a bakery for two years.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Mirror</a>, Styles was 14 years old when he started working at W Mandeville bakery in his hometown of Holmes Chapel, England. The star made Â£6 an hour (roughly $7.80 USD) serving customers, cleaning the back areas and counters, mopping the floors, and washing trays every Saturday (which was, presumably, his day off from school). Though Styles probably lives a very cushy life right now, he apparently never complained about the hard work and was a star among his fellow employees. According to his former boss, Simon Wakefield, the singer was exceedingly polite, and the ladies absolutely loved him, which is pretty much what we'd expect from a future cover boy.</p><p>"The shop suddenly had an influx of girls when Harry worked here. Sometimes there would be 12 of them pouring in at one time. Even now, a group of 20 girls will sometimes come in and start taking photos of the shop," Wakefield told the Mirror. Hey, at least Styles seems to have a pretty good fallback if this whole music thing doesn't work out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9la4N5e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5x5qpq7FdqMG6uMSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
