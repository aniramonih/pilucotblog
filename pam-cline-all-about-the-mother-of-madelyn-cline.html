She came to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, but her father was not happy with her choice. She had just saved enough money to go to California alone. Her parents wanted her to get a college diploma, but she refused. She aspires to be an actress. So while in California, she contacted her mother and informed her that she did not want to pursue the work her parents had planned for her.</p><p>She also dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles. Madelyn also said that she doesn’t want her parents to support her and that she will do this on her own. She just wanted some good wishes and encouragement.

Madelyn struggled to adjust to her new surroundings in Los Angeles. She has no agent and cannot afford to return to her hometown.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pam-Cline-1.jpg" alt="Pam Cline" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She even spent two weeks living in her car.
