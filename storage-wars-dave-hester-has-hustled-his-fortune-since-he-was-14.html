Through his hard work, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he has managed to bag himself a whopping $4 million.</p><p>Hester has made the majority of his money by being one of the leading cast members of A&E’s hit show, Storage Wars, which premiered over a decade ago in 2010.</p><p>However, it isn’t just his reality TV endeavours that have bagged him the cash as he also owns two businesses. One is called the Newport Consignment Gallery and the other is named Rags to Riches, which is a successful and popular thrift store. He has over 25 years of experience within the field so no wonder he is doing so well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dave Hester A&E (@davehester_yuuup)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=dave-earns-a-huge-paycheck-from-storage-wars>Dave earns a huge paycheck from Storage Wars</h2><p>During his time on the show (and now that he is back again) Hester is said to earn a whopping $300,000 salary a year for his appearance, making $25,000 per episode according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Looper</a>. Not that we are jealous or anything…</p><p>He will most likely be making the same amount now that he is back on the show after being fired in 2019. Although he has made his return for season 14, Looper reports that he is “not the same as before.”</p><p>Dave suffered some bad health problems during his absence from the show and reportedly suffered a hemorrhagic stroke due to high blood pressure and sleep apnea.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=dave-was-just-14-when-he-got-into-auctioning>Dave was just 14 when he got into auctioning</h2><p>Dave has been into auctioning and all things hustle since he was just 14 years old. He began buying heavy machinery and tools from area auctions and would sell them on to shops on the military base where he lived.</p><p>In 1992 he became a licensed auctioneer and sold his dad’s huge train collection to gain himself enough money to fund his business. He then set up his two successful shops, the Newport Consignment Gallery and Rags to Riches thrift store.</p><p>His career kicked off from there and his business grew rapidly from starting at a mere 15 employees. He then soon got offered his position as a cast member on Storage Wars and the rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH STORAGE WARS ON A&E EVERY TUESDAY AT 9/8C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXZy8tL%2FIqWSappRiu6bD0miqraeilrSmedaaqaxllJbDpnnHnqqtnaJitaK%2FjKGsrKycmrFutMisZJ%2BnoqnCr7GMrKCnm5VitaZ51pqqZmlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
