Her work in projects like <a href=# rel=follow>The Boys</a>, Dexter, and Sleepy Hollow, has got her to a respectable position in the entertainment business. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actress, however, is not based in Hollywood. After spending over a decade in LA and New York, she is now back in her home country, Sweden.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She did not move there just for a change in scenery, though. Winter has a new life there with her (relatively) new boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Katia Winter’s Ex Husband and Current Boyfriend</h2><p>Winter's love life is not that publicized a subject.&nbsp;The first time her personal life made headlines was in 2016.</p><p>On February 2, 2016, <a href=# rel="follow noopener">TMZ</a> broke the news about Winter filing for a divorce from her husband, Jesse Glick. The outlet got its hands on her divorce filings, which revealed a few things about their separation.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Winter and Glick married in 2013, but things had already gone south by the time June 2015 arrived. They separated that month and eventually filed for divorce in February 2016, reportedly on their second anniversary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Katia Winter</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Katia Winter/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her papers also revealed they neither had any children nor had any shared properties. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After this, the Blood and Tressure actress only talked publicly about her dating life in January 2022.</p><p>During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dagens Nyheter</a>, a Swedish publication, she mentioned having a British boyfriend from a while ago. They had apparently met in the US.</p><p>In autumn 2019, right before the pandemic hit, they planned on moving back to London. But, unable to make that move, they went with a plan B — to stay at her country house a couple of hours north of Stockholm. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Their initial plan was to weather the storm. However, they ended up staying there permanently — "We're having a great time," she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> the publication. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Rumors about Katia Winter’s Relationships</h2><p>Despite being very low-key, Winter's love life still creates a few rumors on the internet. However, rumors about hers seem to be completely baseless.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On August 15, 2022, Mediamass, a website self-admittedly famous for making up stories, chose Winter as their subject of speculation. They published a fabrication about how she was apparently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen shopping</a> for engagement rings with her boyfriend on August 13, 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They even made up a source — Swedish Sun-Times, to lend some first-glance credibility to their fabrication.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another piece</a> published the same day, they made up another story about how the <a href=# rel=follow>Dexter actress</a> might be single. She was "spotted walking alone" on August 13, 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>For this one, they made up some fake tweets to go along with the story. It's safe to say both of these stories were fake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORqbaiedaipa2domKvsMXFq6CeppRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
