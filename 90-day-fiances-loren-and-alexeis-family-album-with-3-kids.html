Some people said, ‘Oh, it’s, it’s totally easy. Like going from one to two is harder, two to three, it’s like nothing. You already have multiples.’ And some people are like, ‘It’s the hardest thing, but it’s so worth it.’”</p><p>Alexei — who met Loren while she was on a Birthright trip to Israel in 2013 — exclusively told Us at the time that their two sons, Shai and Asher, were “doing great” after the arrival of their little sister.</p><p>“They love together, all together. But if you hold Ari and one of them is — I don’t know what, eating his favorite meal — he sees me pick her up, he goes to me,” the Israel native, who tied the knot with Loren in 2015, acknowledged. “No matter what [I’m] doing, but he just comes, he wants to be in it. I’m not allowed to be just with Ari.”</p><p>Since 2020, the couple have welcomed three children in three years: Shai in 2020, Asher in 2021 and Ariel in 2022.</p><p>After starring on 90 Day Fiancé in 2015 — as well as multiple iterations of the show since — <a href=#>the fan-favorite pair</a> scored their own spinoff, Loren and Alexei: After the 90 Days, in 2022, during which viewers get a glimpse of their lives as a couple and as busy parents.</p><p>In addition to their time spent on the small screen, the two frequently keep fans in the loop about their family life via social media, whether they’re <a href=#>celebrating holidays together</a> or just lounging together at home.</p><p>“My heart is so full,” Loren wrote via Instagram in December 2022 alongside a photo of Shai holding his little sister’s hand. Later that month, the TLC stars posed for several shots with their whole family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Happy Holidays! 🥂Cheers!” the couple wrote in the caption of the joint Instagram post, which featured two shots of the family posing for the camera. Loren held Ariel in her arms while Alexei gripped onto the boys, who were attempting to wiggle their way out of their dad’s arms.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the Brovarniks’ sweetest moments as a family of five:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkhnF5w5qwZp6ZlruksdJmo6iqlaN6orrDZpilnaiatrR5xZqkoqSpYq6trtSmZLChpJ16dHnKopusZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
