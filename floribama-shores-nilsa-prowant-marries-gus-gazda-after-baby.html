The following year, the newlyweds <a href=#>announced that they were expecting a child</a> shortly before revealing the little one’s sex.</p><p>“Our faces say it all! I can’t help but to think my dad had a hand in this,” the reality star captioned the social media upload in December 2020, paying tribute to her late father, who died four months prior, while looking forward to welcoming her baby boy.</p><p>Gazda <a href=#>popped the question</a> in January and their son arrived four months later.</p><p>“He is completely perfect in every single possible way. We are so blessed,” Prowant gushed in May, sharing the first snaps of <a href=#>baby Gray Allen</a>. “Thank you God for our beautiful baby boy 💙 this is everything I have always wanted, a family of my own with the man of my dreams. ✨.”</p><p>Transitioning into parenthood wasn’t a simple task. In September, the Florida native opened up about the side of being a mom that not everyone sees, including <a href=#>her battle with postpartum depression and anxiety</a>.</p><p>“I really look up to the moms on Jersey Shore because I know a couple of them have struggled with it,” she told Us Weekly exclusively at the time. “They’ve given me some really good advice and I know that if they can get through it, I can get through it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For Prowant, being a mom has been “enjoyable and rewarding,” but also “one of the hardest things” she’s experienced. “Motherhood is hard, but [I’ll] get through it,” she told Us. “I would suffer from postpartum depression every single day of my life if it means I get to have my son.”</p><p>Prowant pushed through <a href=#>31 hours of labor</a> when Gray arrived. “He didn’t want to come out,” she joked in September. “He loved being up in there. He was super cozy, and I ended up having to have a C-section. It was a really hard labor, but I know other moms have it worse and we’re happy. We’re healthy. I’m grateful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafpJ%2BntqOtzJpkrKCfp7K0ec2io6yZXaW%2FsMPAp6tmpZGnv6qx0maerqtdnK67sMBmmJ%2Bslad6o63BsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
