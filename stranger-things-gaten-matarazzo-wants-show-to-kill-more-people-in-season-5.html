Production on the series was delayed due to the double-whammy writers (WGA) and actors (SAG-AFTRA) strikes last year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The “Stranger Things” cast: Natalia Dyer (from left), Joe Keery, Matarazzo, Maya Hawke, Sadie Sink and Caleb McLaughlin. <span class=credit>Tina Rowden/Netflix</span></figure><p><a href=#>Production on Season 5 kicked off last month</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Matarazzo</a> has played Dustin Henderson on “Stranger Things” since the sci-fi series premiered in 2016.

But I love the way that the Duffer Brothers love their actors.</p><p>“The reason they write so beautifully for me and everyone else is because they fall in love with their actors and their characters, and they don’t want to kill them.”</p><p>Hawke, 25, continued: “I think that’s a beautiful quality that they have, and I wouldn’t wish it away.”</p><p>“Stranger Things” has killed off multiple characters in the past, including Barb (Shannon Purser) in Season 1 and Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) in Season 4.</p><p>The Duffer Brothers told the Guardian that the final season of “Stranger Things” is “like Season 1 on steroids” — and said the show will be bigger in scope as it closes out its five-season run.</p><p>“It’s the biggest it’s ever been in terms of scale, but has been really fun because everyone’s back together in Hawkins,” Matt told <a href=#>the Guardian</a>. “The boys and Eleven interacting more in line with how it was in season one. And, yes, there may be spinoffs, but the story of Eleven and Dustin and Lucas and Hopper, their stories are done here. That’s it …”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Matarazzo in November attending the Los Angeles, California, premiere of the Netflix film “May December.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Last Nov. 6 on “Stranger Things Day,” the Duffer Brothers shared some lines from the Season 5 premiere, called “Chapter One: The Crawl”: “DARKNESS. The sound of COLD WIND. GROANING TREES. And … A CHILD’S VOICE. Singing a familiar song.”</p><p>In addition to Matarazzo and Hawke, the “Stranger Things” cast includes Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven), Noah Schnapp (Will), Finn Wolfhard (Mike), Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Sadie Sink (Max), Joe Keery (Steve), Winona Ryder (Joyce), David Harbour (Hopper) and Natalie Dyer (Nancy).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaW9fmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvSramappeav27Ax6KloKtdnK61sc1mpJqskaeuu8bOZq6apqSoerS0zrBkraddoLatuIympqudXaWysLzLnmSipl2osqK%2Fzqdkbmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
