The new year just started and the mother of four thought her fans would love to see little North spreading some cheer and positivity via her platform.</p><p>The clip was very sweet and North looked so grown up as well!</p><p>The 6 year old can be heard saying: ‘Hi everyone, have a Happy Christmas, Happy Hanukkah and a Happy New Year’s.’</p><p>The footage was shared on January 1 so it was definitely a very nice way to start the decade for some of her most dedicated fans.</p><p>And that was not all! There was also a second video in which the little girl said: ‘Happy birthday, Wendy. Happy Christmas and Happy Hanukkah.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6zM0VCngbO/</p><p>While it’s not clear who the Wendy she was sending her well wishes to was, the proud mother captioned the post with: ‘Look how cute I fund this in my phone! North leaving bday messages to my friends.’</p><p>North looked adorable in a black pajama and had her hair styled in slicked-back pigtails.</p><p>North being cheerful and excited for the holidays is great to see, especially since she was not really present for the family holiday photoshoot this year.</p><p>Instead, they were forced to just Photoshop her in since the child simply refused to participate and her mom could not change her mind.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kim told the talk show host that ‘The next day, she woke up, and she was like, ‘Mommy, I really want to do the card. Thank God that the photographer was still in town. I called the photographer, had her come over.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsecqipGajkaexor%2FHopinZaCkwLW%2FjJysrZ1dq7alec6fZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqWoqqSderi10qGgp59dm66vv4yaZKGZoKXGbrrEsGSynZGnenSBlHJrcWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
