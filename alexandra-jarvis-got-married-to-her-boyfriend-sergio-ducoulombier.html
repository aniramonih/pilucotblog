On December 27, 2020, they were engaged in a private ceremony in Newport Beach, California. The couple’s Instagram account was then updated with the news. Alexandra Jarvis, star of Selling the OC, captioned a photo of them kissing:</p><p><strong>“A fantastic way to bring in the New Year.” I’m ecstatic to marry the love of my life, my best friend, and ride or die.”</strong></p><p>The wedding will take place on April 14, 2023. In an interview with People, Alexandra Jarvis stated the following about her wedding:</p><p><strong>“We wanted a very intimate and romantic wedding day that was free of all of the traditional expectations.” So we decided to go to Italy by ourselves. We’ve been there before, and I told him I loved him there. He had previously told me that he loved me, but I had resisted for a long time.”</strong></p><p>Furthermore, Jarvis stated:</p><p><strong>“It’s a special spot for us.” We chose Lake Como for our wedding because the scenery and natural beauty are breathtaking. It’s the perfect, romantic backdrop for what we had in mind.”</strong></p><p>During the interview, Alexandra Jarvis also stated that she did not want a traditional wedding and the burden of entertaining everyone who would attend. She desired a small wedding so that the couple could exchange vows and enjoy their time together.</p><h2>Michael Costello, a well-known designer, created Alexandra Jarvis’ wedding gown</h2><p>During the interview, she explained how she got involved in the design of the dress:</p><p><strong>“It’s beautiful. It’s a completely unique gown. I met with Michael months ago, and we sat down, and I basically described my concept to him, and he drew it out. That’s exactly what I had in mind. He has a lot of talent.”</strong></p><p>Sergio Ducoulombier and Alexandra took a private boat ride to the nearby town of Bellagio shortly after exchanging vows. The evening came to a close with an Italian dinner. Sergio Ducoulombier and Alexandra returned to Orange County after a wedding celebration with family and friends.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bio, Net Worth, Age, Husband, Height, And Career Of Annette O’Toole</a></h3>A well-known American actress, singer, and dancer is Annette O'Toole.
