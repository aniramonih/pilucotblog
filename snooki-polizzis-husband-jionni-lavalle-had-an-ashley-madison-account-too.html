I mean, Anna Duggar is sympathetic, but any sympathy towards her was bulldozed by the overwhelming desire to call out Josh Duggar and his family for their rank hypocrisy. But this case actually feels a little sad. As it turns out, Snooki Polizzi’s husband Jionni had an account on Ashley Madison. Probably. Maybe.</p><p>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi’s husband, Jionni LaValle, may have had an Ashley Madison account. The email address of the Jersey Shore star’s hubby matches one that was used for an account on the affair website, Us Weekly has discovered.</p><p>As previously reported, hackers last week released stolen information of more than 37 million subscribers to the Canada-based website, which links married men and women looking to have extramarital affairs.</p><p>The hack is under investigation by the Toronto Police Department after two possible suicides are reported to be potentially connected to the leak. The release of the stolen subscriber data has tied other famous names to the controversial website. TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting alum Josh Duggar admitted on Thursday, Aug. 20, to cheating on his wife, Anna Duggar; Real Housewives of New York City star Kristen Taekman’s husband, Josh, had his email address used for an account but denied that it was his; and Christian blogger Sam Rader admitted that he had used the website, but never cheated. Louisiana GOP executive director Jason Doré’s information was also included in the leak, but he said he used the account to research his political opponents.</p><p>In January, Snooki, 27, shot down rumors that LaValle, 28, was cheating on her. “My man ain’t goin’ nowhere #shady,” she tweeted following a report that her husband had flirted and exchanged numbers while out with a woman in Florida.</p><p>The longtime couple said “I do” in November 2014. Together they shares kids Lorenzo, 2, and Giovanna, 10 months.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>What’s really starting to bother me is the fact that so many of these men were signing up for Ashley Madison when their wives/partners were pregnant or had just given birth. It’s such a nightmare. Anyway, I don’t know much about Jionni but I’m sure he’ll be able to give some kind of excuse like “I had an account but I was only looking, I never met anybody!”</p><p>Here are some photos of Snooki at the Chippendales show in Las Vegas over the weekend. Her whole face has changed, right?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FFN_Snooki_Chip_RIA_082315_51830808.jpg alt=FFN_Snooki_Chip_RIA_082315_51830808 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FFN_Snooki_Chip_RIA_082315_51830806.jpg alt=FFN_Snooki_Chip_RIA_082315_51830806 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWxjboF0e9KnpqijmZS9sLjIs7Giq4%2BdwrSuwKebmKKZpLuvtb6lmK%2BZnKGyoLTAnZaapo%2BWwKm4xLKWppmUnsCwur6ampynpaPBoMDOqGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
