"Then I took the time to do some introspection. I thought, 'Where am I going to go from here? I had a sense of accomplishment that I had fulfilled my promise to my best friend and that I had done everything I could in my three years with WWE, and after several consultations with WWE, I decided to leave," she continued.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Cross-Promotion Matches Between Stardom And AEW We'd Love To See</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>KAIRI initially bid farewell to the WWE Universe</a> in July 2020 when she decided to step away from in-ring activities and move back to her native Japan. Sane later confirmed that, although she was no longer a WWE Superstar, she would remain on the company payroll in a <a href=#>new position as a WWE brand ambassador</a> in Japan. WWE eventually pulled the plug on its operation in Japan and KAIRI became a free agent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kairi-sane-stardom-2022-wwe.jpg><p>In February, KAIRI returned to Japanese promotion Stardom during a press conference. KAIRI was interrupted by Nakano and Sayaka. It was later confirmed that KAIRI would team with Iwatani at the World Climax event. KAIRI worked for Stardom for 6 years before joining WWE in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After I returned to Japan, I had not been watching professional wrestling with much enthusiasm. But when I went to Stardom's Budokan last year, the feeling of "I want to fight with everyone someday" came up from my heart," KAIRI said of her decision to return to Stardom in the aforementioned Entame Next interview.</p><p><strong>TheSportster Podcast has returned!
