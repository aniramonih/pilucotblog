Finally, after making lots of calls, I was able to get a hold of him and I ask him, ‘Shaq you got my son?’ He’s like Yeah, he wanted to come with me I took him to get a haircut. I was trying to make sense of it he takes my son and then gives him a haircut, who does this? And I thought to myself should I call the cops?”</p><p>Incidents like these made them brothers they are today; They continue to hold on to these fun memories and pull each other’s leg whenever they get the opportunity.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“A true way to honor a legend” Celtics’ Bill Russell City Edition jerseys will get fans hyped</a></p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Don’t find the first door and run out” $90 Million Heat GM humiliated LeBron James in front of public and media</a></p><p>Do follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://news.google.com/s/CBIwhuWAo00?sceid=IN:en&sceid=IN:en&r=11&oc=1" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News </a>|&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.facebook.com/firstsportz/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/firstsportz/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/SportzFirst rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBut8SnpbJlo6K2tbTSZpqopaCnsqmxzaygr51dlrCku9Snq2annmK1sMOMoZxmmpWYrq6xjJupqKyYmr%2B0edaiq6Flo52ussHIpaOeZZ%2BjsqK4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
