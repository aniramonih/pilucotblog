He stars in the romantic flick alongside <strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong>, <strong><a href=#>Keira Knightley</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld</a></strong>.</p><p>His costars, however, are undoubtedly making slightly more for the project than he is.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm very lucky that I'm in that position," the Maroon 5 crooner continued. <a href=#>According to a story by the Hollywood Reporter</a>, he brought in about $35 million in 2013 alone. "I want to have good experiences. I don't want to do a bunch of sâ€“t that I hate. I want to treat [acting] completely differently because I have the very fortunate luxury of not having to think of this in terms of money."</p><p>Begin Again, which is set for wide release on July 11, features Levine as the bad boy ex-boyfriend of Knightley's character. Pursuing a music career, she goes on to meet Ruffalo's character, who is a failed executive in the music business.</p><p>Levine previously made a cameo in the NBC television show 30 Rock as himself, and acted in a few episodes of FX's American Horror Story in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmpuapV2hsre1zZ5knaGUYq%2Bms8inZJqfkZ67brnOr6CeZZakv26y0Z6cZq%2BRo8GmsIyer6mdop6yr6%2FEZmlpaWRmhA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
