Well, the odds-on favorite, based on the </span><a href=#>multiple clues presented throughout the show</a><span>, is veteran entertainer </span><a href=#>Donny Osmond</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the first week's clue package, The Peacock said he "walked onto a stage for the first time" when he was five years old and has been performing ever since. Osmond sang, alongside his brothers, on </span><span>The Andy Williams Show</span><span> in 1963, when he was five years old.</span></p><p><span>While Harris was famously a child star, his debut role came in the 1988 film </span><span>Clara's Heart</span><span>, which he made when he was already a teenager.</span></p><p><span>The Peacock also told viewers that it's "probably been a while since your mom had a poster of me on her bedroom wall," indicating that his massive popularity had waned some time ago. Osmond, while still a successful musician, was a wildly popular teeny bopper star in his younger years.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, The Peacock said he'd been "dear friends" with the late Michael Jackson. Osmond and the King of Pop were famously friends for decades while&nbsp;it doesn't appear that Harris had any sort of close relationship with Jackson during his life.</span></p><p><span>These are just a few of the many, many clues that confirm that Osmond is The Peacock. However, it seems that Harris' name keeps coming up because of the frequent clues about magic and being a magician -- not traits typically associated with Osmond's repertoire.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, that's just a lesser-known aspect of his career. Osmond and his famous sister, Marie Osmond, have performed magic acts together in Las Vegas many times in the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, basically, Harris is telling the truth. But you gotta hand it to </span><span>The Masked Singer</span><span>'s tweet: the denial did sound pretty suspicious.</span></p><p><a href=#>The Masked Singer</a><span> airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Fox, and </span><a href=#>ET Liveblogs every episode every week</a><span> if you want to watch along with us.
