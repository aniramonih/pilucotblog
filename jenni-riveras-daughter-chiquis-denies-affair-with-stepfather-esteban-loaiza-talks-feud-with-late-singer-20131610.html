The eldest daughter of the singing legend spoke with <a href=# rel=noopener>Azteca America</a> in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Oct. 15, revealing that she and her late mother were not on speaking terms at the time of her death in December 2012.</p><p>“The world and my family lost Jenni on December 9, I lost my mother two months before on October 2. It was a misunderstanding,” she said of the mother-daughter argument that led to their estrangement. “My world ended that day.”</p><p>According to Marin, 28, Rivera had filed for divorce from her third husband, former MLB pitcher <strong>Esteban Loaiza</strong>, just one day earlier, claiming that her daughter had had an affair with her stepfather (Marin’s father is Rivera’s first husband, <strong>Jose Trinidad Marin</strong>).</p><p>“I don’t understand how the rumor got started, this horrible thing that has caused so much suffering,” Marin told Azteca America. “[Loaiza] has always been very respectful towards me and me with him.”</p><p>“There were so many people filling her head with things,” she continued. “If there’s a problem with someone you should ask them directly, and that’s something she didn’t do. To this day, my mother, in her heart, thinks I had something with Esteban.”</p><p>Rivera, who died in a tragic plane crash near Monterrey, Mexico, on Dec. 9, never explained the reasons for her divorce filing, only saying that the issue was so severe that she could not talk about it.</p><p>The Mexican singer and TV star kicked Marin out of her home shortly after the pair stopped speaking.</p><p>“Every day I have to live with this, no one know the pain I carry, especially because it was a misunderstanding, there were so many people int he middle that caused so much pain, so many problems that it was impossible not to be upset,” Marin said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the mother and daughter were not in communication at the time of Rivera’s death, the legendary singer reportedly dedicated her song “Paloma Negra” to her daughter just hours before her fatal plane crash. The song’s lyrics describe a feud and a hope for reconciliation.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Univision</a>, Marin will play Rivera in an upcoming biopic about the late singer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtm6%2ByK%2Bcq5mjYrGiwcahq56qXZi1qr3UoqpmnJWjtqa%2FjJqdn5mZp3q4tdOhZKyslaWzosDHnqlmnaOpsqOtzWajqJmZr65uwMCloqxllprCpXnWoquhZZyWwaZ50qKloJ2iYn9xfZJqbWpoXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
