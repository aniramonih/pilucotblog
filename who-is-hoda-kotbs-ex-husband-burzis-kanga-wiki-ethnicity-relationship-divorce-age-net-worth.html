According to reports, there were numerous people at the event particularly bachelors. Their relationship began, and in 2005 the two decided to marry, however, it wasn’t up to their expectations as the marriage did not last, and just three years later, the two finalized their <a rel=nofollow href=#>divorce</a>. Prior to their divorce, Hoda was diagnosed with breast cancer, and treated the disease by undergoing a mastectomy.</p><p>After the procedure, she had reconstructive surgery to help alleviate the physical damage, and since when she has become an advocate for breast cancer awareness. She allowed the “Today Show” cameras to follow her throughout her cancer journey, which documented her progress until it was declared that she was cancer free.</p><h2><span id=Aftermath_and_Current_Endeavors><strong>Aftermath and Current Endeavors</strong></span></h2><p>Burzis and Hoda moved on after the divorce and went their separate ways. He was able to move farther from the spotlight over the many years that passed, as most still had their attention on his ex-wife. She had another relationship which ended, but in 2015 announced that she had been in a relationship with financier Joel Schiffman for two years. In 2017, she adopted a baby girl, making the announcement on the “Today Show”.</p><p>On the other hand, there is no information regarding any of Kanga’s current endeavors.

His ex-wife on the other hand with the nature of her work is very active online, and continues to let followers view a good portion of her personal life through social media, with accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, on which she posts various personal photos. She also promotes some of her recent work, as well as posting inspirational quotes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdnbylrYykpq2ao2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6ZeqPB0bOgrGWblruorYywoKShXZrBqbrInKCtsV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1usMivpqublWKuqLGMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
