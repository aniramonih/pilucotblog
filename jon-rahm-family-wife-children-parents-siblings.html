He was the number one golfer in the World Amateur Golf Ranking for a then-record 60 weeks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Rahm was born on November 10th, 1994 in the Basque Country’s Barrika, Biscay. He competed on Spanish amateur teams that won the 2011 European Boys’ Team Championship and the 2014 European Amateur Team Championship.</p><p>He represented Spain at various amateur levels. He led the team in the 2014 Eisenhower Trophy competition. He received a golf scholarship to attend Arizona State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. In school history, he won 11 college golf competitions there, which is second only to Phil Mickelson’s 16 victories. He speaks English, Spanish, and Basque fluently.</p><p>As the top amateur golfer in 2015, he received the Mark H. McCormack Medal, which entitles him to the U.S. Open and Open Championship the following year. Before finishing tied for third in the national final, he finished his collegiate career by capturing the Pac-12 Conference title and an NCAA regional title. He finished his final tournament as an amateur in a tie for 23rd place at 7-over-par, making him the low amateur in the 2016 U.S. Open.</p><p>Rahm’s exemption to the 2016 Open Championship was lost when he turned professional following the U.S. Open. Rahm took part in his first professional competition the following week at the Quicken Loans National. He finished tied for third place, four strokes behind the winner, Billy Hurley III, after holding or sharing the lead for the first two rounds.</p><p>Rahm’s performance was sufficient to re-enter The Open because the Quicken Loans National was a part of the Open Qualifying Series. Rahm tied for second place in the RBC Canadian Open, earning him membership as a Special Temporary Member for the rest of the year. He collected enough points as a non-member to qualify for the 2017 PGA Tour.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jon-rahm-family-who-are-his-wife-and-children><strong>Jon Rahm family: Who are his wife and children</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Jon Rahm is married to Kelley.
