Knight) delivered.</p><p>That’ll lead to Valentin returning sooner than planned, so he’ll be just as suspicious of Anna when he realizes how weird she’s acting.</p><p>Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) will also pick up on Dex Heller’s (Evan Hofer) mood shift at the Metro Court pool.</p><p>Dex will fear that he’s been exposed on his surveillance mission, so it looks like he’ll briefly take his anger out on Joss before apologizing.</p><p>Hudson West will also reprise his role as Jake Webber for some new scenes with Elizabeth Baldwin (Rebecca Herbst) and Austin Gatlin-Holt (Roger Howarth).</p><p>Since GH spoilers say Liz and Austin will care for a patient, Jake might get injured and need some medical attention.</p><p>Gregory Chase (Gregory Harrison) will also have an appointment with Dr. Bronson (Jeffrey Stubblefield), so that’ll bring some difficult updates regarding the progression of his ALS.</p><p>Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) will thank Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) for being there for Gregory as they ultimately head to an AA meeting together.</p><p>Back with Sonny, he’ll land on the hot seat with Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros).</p><p>Nina may once again demand answers about Sonny’s secret with Ava Jerome (Maura West) since she can tell it seems dangerous.</p><p>During the week of August 28-September 1, Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) will back Martin into a corner and push him to confess everything he’s been hiding.</p><p>Martin is indeed keeping secrets regarding The Decepter as well as the alimony payments he’s been receiving, so Lucy will want the whole truth.</p><p>Walt Willey will also return as Jackson Montgomery, so it’ll be fun to see how he fits into Lucy and Martin’s story this time around.</p><p>Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) will cause total mayhem with her own Deception-related revelations, so the company could end up in financial freefall by the end of all this.</p><p>Next, Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) will get some shocking information – and it’ll most likely tie in with Gladys Corbin (Bonnie Burroughs), who’ll apparently try and fail to manipulate Nina.</p><p>There’ll be some stunning intel for Nina to uncover, so she’ll hopefully start to get a clue about Gladys’ awful treatment of Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson) and link to devious Dr. Damon Montague (Darin Toonder).</p><p>Later, Nina will get a chance to hang out with Wiley Quartermaine-Corinthos (Viron Weaver), so she’ll be grateful to Willow Corinthos (Katelyn MacMullen) for this bonding time with her grandson.</p><p>As for Sonny and Brick (Stephen A. Smith), they’ll do some brainstorming and come up with another strategy.</p><p>That could involve a way to expose Betty Rutherford (Ella Lentini), Austin and Mason Gatlin’s (Nathanyael Grey) boss.</p><p>At Ferncliff, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) will try to visit Sasha, but he’ll no doubt run into some trouble.</p><p>Gladys and Dr. Montague’s efforts to keep Sasha so isolated may leave Dante concerned about what’s really going on.</p><p>Elsewhere, Cody Bell (Josh Kelly) may stick to his plan to try and get committed to Ferncliff. We’ll see Cody put on some sort of outlandish act, so that could lead to him getting his wish.</p><p>Although Olivia Quartermaine (Lisa LoCicero) will gain a deeper understanding of “Eddie Maine” aka Ned Quartermaine (Wally Kurth) and enjoy getting to know him, she won’t stop missing her real husband.</p><p>That’s why Olivia will come up with a plan to hopefully spark some memories for Ned, so stay tuned to see if she succeeds or crashes and burns.</p><p>At his rehab facility, Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) will get some much-needed guidance from Stella Henry (Vernee Watson), who may urge him to stop pushing Portia Robinson (Brook Kerr) away.</p><p>Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Chavez) will also find a helpful confidant since he’ll take his problems to Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) and get some advice.</p><p>Over with Selina Wu (Lydia Look), her plot will be thwarted. Selina might try and fail to get her hands on The Savoy since Marshall Ashford (Robert Gossett) is so determined to protect it.</p><p>Across town, Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) will have a proposal for someone to consider, so it seems Brook Lynn will be on the receiving end of it.</p><p>Although Brook Lynn will express doubt over Chase’s idea, he’ll work to sell her on it.</p><p>There’s a chance this will involve some Deception-related solution, but it might involve popping the question instead.</p><p>Chase may get the sad news of Gregory’s illness and decide to seize the day with Brook Lynn when it comes to an engagement, but we’ll see how it all plays out!</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say the next two weeks will be packed with action, so stay tuned!</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for terrific <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your top GH source.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ynnLGsXWd6uLHEpKpmqpWpwrO6yKeeZpuYlr%2Bir9OeqaxllJ7AtcHRm6Cnn12ZtrSvzq%2Bcq6GVqHq0tM6coqKml2K9s7vPqKqapF2Wu6V5wqikqZmernqktMCoqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
