A collaboration between <strong>Rihanna</strong> and her ex-boyfriend <strong>Chris Brown</strong> surfaced on Monday, April 20, and the track features some seriously raunchy lyrics.&nbsp;</p><p>The estranged lovers, who had an infamously combative relationship and multiple ugly breakups, <a href=#>reportedly recorded the song more than a year ago</a> for potential inclusion on Brown's 2014 album, x. While it never made it onto the record, the track, called "Put It Up," has finally seen the light of day.</p><p>Over a mid-tempo R&B beat, Rihanna, now 27, croons, "Baby you don't need to be scared of me / I guarantee that I'm not a mistake / I'mma give you all of my love / And I hope that you won't misplace it / You created this s–t / Going insane with all of this fear / Can't turn my back on it / I'm in love gotta' face it."&nbsp;</p><p>The "American Oxygen" singer broke up with Brown, now 25, in 2009, <a href=#>following his brutal assault</a> that left her unable to perform at the Grammy Awards the day after the domestic violence. The two later reconciled in January 2013, and Rih said of Brown at the time, "Even if it's a mistake, it's my mistake. After being tormented for so many years, being angry and dark, I'd rather just live my truth and take the backlash. I can handle it."</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown, whose relationship with Rihanna ended again in the summer of 2013, joins "Put It Up," rapping, "You're the only one I wanna stay on the phone with / Oh the late night Skype sex / On that young s–t / Girl you keep it one hunnit / Always gon' hold me down / You know you're the number one / Girl I'mma work you out."</p><p>In one particularly talked-about verse, the two duet, singing, "Your property, treat me like I'm your property / Do what you wanna, take command / I'm about to be your biggest fan."</p><p>Take a listen to the boundary-pushing number in the video above.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhqpmoeqO%2BzrClZpylmsFuw8itn2aqmZ2ur7rAZqquqpaWsKa%2FjLCgraBdp662usKhsGakqae2pL%2BMnZytmZmhwG5%2Bj2psa2hk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
