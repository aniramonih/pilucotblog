On March 15, Kent and her fiancé Randall Emmett welcomed their first baby&nbsp;together, Ocean Kent Emmett. Similarly, the Vanderpump Rules star released her first book, Give Them Lala, on May 4 and has already become a National Best-Selling Author.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On May 6, Kent gave an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>with Fox 5’s Good Day DC on their We Love You Moms series. There she discussed her new book, season 9 of Vanderpump Rules, and of course, motherhood.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Kent Wants Ocean To Read Her Book&nbsp;</h2><p>During the virtual interview, Kent mentioned she would want her daughter Ocean to read Give Them Lala.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Life has not been easy on the 30-year-old and everything she has gone through, she's poured it into her book. The reality star’s book is all about her experiences in life—from her battle with alcoholism, coping with her father’s death, and her journey in Vanderpump Rules.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She wants her daughter to know about her experiences and what she went through in life. Kent wants Ocean to analyze what and why her mother did what she did and question if the actress made the right decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With all the experiences the model has accumulated over the years, she wants her daughter to know that she would always be with her and support her no matter what. The best way for Ocean to realize this would be to read Kent’s book; hence, she hopes her daughter will&nbsp;read her book.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The model’s book has not made it to the New York Times Best Sellers; however, she has made her name on the National Best-Selling Author list.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kent, Fiancé, And Motherhood</h2><p>Emmett is a film producer known for movies like 2 Guns and The Irishman. Before dating Kent, he was married to actress Ambyr Childers. They were married from 2009 to 2017 and share two daughters — London and Rylee Emmett.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Before officially announcing her and the movie producer’s relationship, Kent was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> to be dating a married man. She used to mention him on Vanderpump Rules by calling him ‘her man.’&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, after Emmett and Childers’ divorce was finalized, the couple finally announced their relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The duo announced their engagement on September 2018 but are yet to tie the knot. Initially, they were supposed to get married on April 2020, but they had to reschedule it because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with the OK Magazine, the model revealed they had to reschedule the wedding three times.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the pandemic and postponing, the duo has given up and has no plans for getting married soon. Kent said that she was tired of referring to Emmett as her fiancé, so regardless of them not getting married, she officially called him her husband.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>We deserve the title of husband and wife — we fought hard for this relationship.</p><p>In a virtual <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conversation</a> with Access Hollywood, the reality TV star opened up more about motherhood and Emmett.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She revealed that even though Emmett already has two daughters, he was expecting his child with Kent also to be a girl. Kent hilariously opened up about how Emmett was nervous about raising a boy at 50.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The model also shared about how they named their daughter ‘Ocean.’ People had presumed that they named their daughter because the couple loved oceans a lot; however, there was an adorable backstory to it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>A few years ago, the pair had taken a trip to the Bahamas. One day, there were on a walk when they saw a yacht&nbsp;named Ocean Alexander. Kent fell in love with the name so much that there and then she decided she would call her firstborn Ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>And that is exactly what they did. Ocean is now three months old and is making her mother elated. Kent opened up that motherhood has made her extremely happy and claimed it to be “beyond anything anyone could have prepared her for”.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She is enjoying this experience a lot up to the extent that if she could, she would relive the childbirth over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnJa5onnKnqWtZaeasaW1zaBkmqaUYq%2Birthnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
