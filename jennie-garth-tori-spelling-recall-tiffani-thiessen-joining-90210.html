Like, we’re doing great. … Why is someone coming to fill the Brenda’s shoes?’ It just felt, like, I don’t know. … I didn’t get it,” Garth said. “And I was probably not that open to the concept. But it worked for my character, that’s for sure. … Kelly and Val never got along. … Kelly’s very intuitive about people and their character and she goes off her gut, and I feel like Kelly smelled a ratatouille.”</p><p>The actresses’ cohost, <strong>Amy Sugarman</strong>, referred to the situation as “life imitates art again,” hinting at alleged tension between Garth and Thiessen. Thiessen, for her part, told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> in 2012 that she was “shunned” by her female costars. The two women were close at one point in time, however, as Thiessen was a bridesmaid in Garth’s wedding to <a href=#><strong>Peter Facinelli.</strong></a></p><p>Spelling, for her part, added, “I was just like, me/Donna as usual, like, ‘Hi? How are you? Welcome! Please like me.’”</p><p>All three hosts wondered how fans reacted to seeing Thiessen’s Valerie move into Doherty’s Brenda’s bedroom. (Doherty <a href=#>infamously left Beverly Hills, 90210</a>, after four seasons amid tension on the set with her costars and bosses.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jennie-Garth-and-Tori-Spelling-Recall-Tiffani-Thiessen-Joining-Beverly-Hills.jpg><p>“It just was really weird watching Valerie in Brenda’s bathroom like that. My overall gut instinct — as a viewer, watching it and being connected and attached to the original cast and to Brenda and to Brenda’s bedroom — I was like, ‘Well, I don’t like what’s happening. I don’t like what my eyes are seeing. I don’t understand this. It’s upsetting me,’” Garth said. “And that she’s now going to be a bad girl instead of a main character that we love. But do people come to love Valerie? … Did anyone ever feel the way they felt about Brenda about Valerie?”</p><p>While Spelling stayed fairly mum during the chat, she did point out that Valerie is going to “take all of our men on this show” — which Garth didn’t like either. (The character strikes up romances with <a href=#>Luke Perry</a>’s Dylan, <strong>Brian Austin Green’s</strong> David,<strong> Ian Ziering</strong>’s Steve, <strong>Vincent Young</strong>’s Noah, <strong>Jason Wiles</strong>’ Colin and has a longtime crush on <strong>Jason Priestley’s</strong>&nbsp;Brandon.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Wait, Brandon hooks up with Valerie?! I can’t,” Garth said. “All of the guys hook up with her? Well, that doesn’t make me like her very much.”</p><p>Garth and Spelling remained on Beverly Hills, 90210, for the show’s entire 10-season run, while Thiessen left during season 9 and returned for the series finale in 2000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepp6esm6zwKuroWWkpL%2BqedKpnKWkmaO0br7EnJilpF2ptqeywKegZqyYnrK0v8SnZKOnmaO2r7OMcmdraWBk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
