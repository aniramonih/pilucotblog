Voldemort was able to attach himself to <b>Quirrell when he failed to wash his hands after</b> using a public lavatory.</strong></p><p>Why did Professor Quirrell turn evil? Quirrell set out deliberately <b>to find whatever remained of the Dark wizard</b>, partly out of curiosity, partly out of that unacknowledged desire for importance. … When Voldemort realised that the young man had a position at Hogwarts, he took immediate possession of Quirrell, who was incapable of resisting.</p><p>Simply so, Is Professor Quirrell Voldemort? As it turned out, Quirrell <b>was a servant of Voldemort</b>, and it was he, not Snape, who was aiming to steal the Philosopher’s Stone for the Dark Lord, and, if possible, kill Harry along the way.</p><p>Why was Professor Quirrell not a Horcrux? Quirrel wasn’t a horcrux. <b>He was just a body Voldemort’s spirit was able to inhabit</b>. And that too temporarily. That’s why Voldemort wanted the philosopher’s stone.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Quirrell_turban_smell></span>Why did Quirrell turban smell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Quirinus Quirrell’s classroom, as well as his turban, were said to <b>smell strongly of garlic</b>, which many students believed was to protect against a vampire Quirrell claimed to have met on his travels in Romania. … Potter that his breath may smell of garlic, only to be told by Lily that it smelt of porridge.</p><p>Also Did Dumbledore know about Quirrell? Dumbledore knew about quirrell <b>just as he knew about malfoy in the 6th book</b>. Im sure snape must have also told him but dumbledore probably suspected that something was off with Quirrell from the start of the year.</p><p>Why does Voldemort have no nose? He lost his nose gradually throughout the years as he sunk deeper and deeper into evil, <b>and lost more parts of his soul</b>. As his soul went, it also affected his physical features. His face became waxy, distorted. This is a metaphor for him losing his humanity.</p><p>Why was Quirrell holding an iguana?

This casts people with disabilities as people who can’t be strong or powerful.</p><p>Why did Lupin get hired? Dumbledore hired Lupin, despite him being a werewolf, because: <b>He wanted to give Lupin a chance</b>, and unlike most wizards, didn’t have a stigma against werewolves.

When Quirrell takes a trip to Albania, the last rumored location of Voldemort, and comes back a stuttering mess, Dumbledore probably instantly knew what was up. He just couldn’t catch him in the act. So, he <b>let him go for the Stone</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Voldemort_part_snake></span>Is Voldemort part snake?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Nagini</b> is a core figure in the Harry Potter universe. She’s Lord Voldemort’s loyal snake; a creature who slithers close to him, acting not only as the Dark Lord’s weapon, but also a safe keeper for his horcrux.</p><p>Are Crabbe and Goyle Death Eaters?</p><p>Both Crabbe and <b>Goyle have fathers who are Death Eaters</b>. … Voldemort addresses them by name in the Little Hangleton graveyard. No wonder their sons like to cluster around Draco Malfoy: it’s basically an imitation of their fathers’ Death Eater social dynamic.</p><p>Who let the troll into Hogwarts?

This was a diversion so he could reconnoitre the defences around the Stone.</p><p>Was Quirrell faking his stutter? The most obvious mention of stuttering was the character Professor Quirrell.
