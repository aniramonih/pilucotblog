His net worth primarily comes from his three albums and his involvement with the group Dyslexic Speedreaders, comprising Simon Rex, Andre Legacy, and Beardo. He began his career in 2002.</p><p>According to sources, Mickey Avalon’s overall net worth is estimated at $8 million, earned through his musical career.</p><h3>Mickey Avalon’s Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Mickey grew up in Hollywood with four siblings; tragically, his sister succumbed to a drug overdose. His early life was marked by substance abuse, as both of his parents were addicts, and his mother was involved in drug dealing, influencing Mickey to join the same business. In his 20s, he managed to distance himself from drugs and started creating music with his friend Simon Rex.</p><p>Mickey’s net worth received a significant boost when his first album, “Mickey Avalon,” was released in 2006 through My Space Records. Subsequently, his second album, “Loaded,” released in 2012 through Suburban Noize Records, and his latest solo release, the 2013 EP “I Get Even,” under RagTop Records, further augmented his net worth.</p><p>In addition to his solo work, Mickey was a member of the hip-hop group Dyslexic Speedreaders. The group’s 2004 debut album, “Catching Up To Wilt,” and their collaboration with Living Legends on the track “Nevermind” in 2007, all contributed to Mickey’s net worth. Despite leaving the group in 2010 due to financial disputes, he continued to gain popularity through his own releases, including the song “What Do You Say,” featured in the film “Hangover,” and hits such as “My Dick”, “Jane Fonda”, “Mr. Right”, “I Am Hot”, and “Stroke Me”.</p><p>Mickey’s net worth grew further through his stage performances, touring with artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kesha, Snoop Dogg, and Stephen Marley, among others.</p><p>Throughout his career, Mickey has collaborated with numerous music artists, including Shape Shifters, Living Legends, and Unwritten Law.</p><p>Mickey’s life has been filled with challenges, from selling drugs on the streets to becoming a renowned artist. His future holds the potential for a greater career and increased net worth, provided he can maintain a clean lifestyle.</p><p>On the personal front, Mickey faced various tribulations; he married in his early 20s and had a daughter but is now divorced. He also endured the tragic loss of his sister to a drug overdose while attempting to support her through her struggles with addiction. Additionally, he resorted to male prostitution to sustain his drug habit. Furthermore, at 19, he made the difficult decision to remove his father from life support following a severe injury caused by a drunk driver.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mickey Avalon</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 3, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Rapper, Songwriter, Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Yeshe Perl , Avalon, Mickey</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/MickeyAvalon</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/mickeyavalon</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/mickey_avalon</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>http://www.myspace.com/mickeyavalon</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://imdb.com/name/nm2560697</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Interscope Records, Suburban Noize Records, MySpace Records</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Mickey Avalon, Loaded, I Get Even</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>We’re the Millers</td><td>2013</td><td>performer: “Stroke Me” / writer: “Stroke Me”</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell</td><td>2009</td><td>performer: “Jane Fonda” / writer: “Jane Fonda” – as Yeshe Perl</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hung</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer – 1 episode, 2009 writer – 1 episode, 2009</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Willkommen Österreich</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series performer – 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Hangover</td><td>2009</td><td>performer: “What Do You Say?” / writer: “What Do You Say?”</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay</td><td>2008</td><td>performer: “My Dick” / writer: “My Dick” – as Yeshe Perl</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Entourage</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer – 1 episode, 2006 writer – 1 episode, 2006</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Playboy Morning Show</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty Wild</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Rockstar</td></tr><tr><td>The Heart Is a Drum Machine</td><td>2009</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Epidemic</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Spread TV</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Musical Guest</td></tr><tr><td>The Simple Life</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmikopubmsZurdWao6imo2LEpq3LrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
