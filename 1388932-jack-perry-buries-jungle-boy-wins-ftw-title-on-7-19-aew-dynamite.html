Instead, Jack Perry is here, and shocked HOOK to win the FTW Championship tonight on <a href=#>AEW Dynamite</a>.</p><p>During the FTW Championship match at tonight’s Blood and Guts-themed episode of Dynamite, Perry “buried” the persona of Jungle Boy in a clip that preceded his entrance. While Jungle Boy’s theme music played before the match, a video popped up that showed Perry burying something, before a limo pulled up to drive him away. Afterward, Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 5” began playing, and out came the new Perry.</p><p>During the match, Perry would eventually get the upper hand thanks to some late-match shenanigans. Toward the end of the match, Perry tried to attack HOOK with the title, but HOOK evaded it. Instead, the referee would get knocked down, and after taking a suplex from HOOK, Perry would eventually hit the champion with his own belt before pinning and winning the man and ending his undefeated streak to claim his first singles title.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>For a recap of how the match ended, check out below courtesy of our <a href=#>live, play-by-play coverage of AEW’s special Blood and Guts-themed episode of AEW Dynamite</a>:</p><p>Perry’s entrance music hits, but he doesn’t come out.
