During a 2020 chat with <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Hall revealed that he and Ringwald briefly saw each other after they'd finished their roles as Brian Johnson and Claire Standish in "The Breakfast Club."&nbsp;"It was puppy love," Hall said. He then noted that a love connection wasn't immediate when he and Ringwald collaborated for the first time. "[Ringwald] didn't have the time of day for me when we made 'Sixteen Candles.' We did 'Sixteen Candles,' and I was annoying to her!" Hall said. "So it was really funny — it kind of hit me by surprise when we had our little thing there, but it was fun." Hall then called Ringwald "wonderful" and "a great lady." "We've been friends since, and I've seen her over the years," Hall added.</p><p>Ringwald recounted their brief relationship for the&nbsp;2010 book&nbsp;<a href=#>"You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried,"</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;revisits the work of filmmaker John Hughes and the Brat Pack.&nbsp;"We got together at the end of 'The Breakfast Club,' and we were together a few months," Ringwald said of herself and Hall before adding, "I&nbsp;think mostly because we were the only people that we knew — practically, in the world — that were the same age, that were doing the same thing." Hall and Ringwald have both ended up in lasting romances since their own relationship fizzled.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppbIVyhY6apa2gn6PGbrnInJ%2BanZxitaK4y2akqKScrnqztc2grpqklGKzrbXNoGSanqSav27Ax55km6qVlrinrdKtZJykpZd8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
