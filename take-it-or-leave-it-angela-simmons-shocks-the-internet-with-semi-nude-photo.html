Simmons put her unclad body on display to her six million followers and posed on a wooden bench with her legs crossed and her wavy tresses covering her exposed areas.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Angela Simmons Make Heads Turn with These Thirst-Traps (opens in a new tab)">Angela Simmons Make Heads Turn with These Thirst-Traps</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ans.png><p>Seemingly firing back at naysayers who’ve criticized her former fashions, Simmons captioned her post, “You accuse her of being ill-dressed. I agree. Clothes don’t become her. I’m not what I wear, I’m not what I don’t wear. I am Who I am regardless .. take it or leave it.”</p><p>The “<strong><a aria-label="Growing Hip Hop (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Growing Hip Hop</a></strong>” star drummed up more than 142,000 likes on her Instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" href=#>post</a>, including a wave of mixed reactions.</p><p>“Oh my Lordy! 🔥🤤 Damn Angela you looking Beautiful🔥 girl them legs and thighs and gift of god truly asiatic black women is heaven poor righteous”</p><p>“A preacher’s daughter nude ??

(opens in a new tab)">tasteless.</a>”</p><p>The mother of one has often been judged for her revealing clothing choices in the past by many of her followers, especially since she identifies as a Christian.</p><p>“People will come up to me and say, ‘Oh ,you shouldn’t be wearing that skirt.’ And I just say, ‘Why not?’” she previously told Rolling Out during an interview in 2013. “I’m not doing it distastefully, and I’m not being disrespectful. I have my relationship with God, so therefore I don’t feel like anyone should judge me. But it’s life, and people are going to judge.”</p><p>As of late, Simmons made it clear that she’s extremely confident in herself and doesn’t care much what people think.</p><p>She <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wrote (opens in a new tab)" href=#>wrote </a>on Oct. 29 via Instagram, “con·fi·dence /ˈkänfədəns/ * a feeling of self-assurance arising from one’s appreciation of one’s own abilities or qualities 💞.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e5BpZmxpX6murLGMoqtmp6Jiuaat1Z5koqxdlruoscuaZKyhnaK8r7%2BMrJ%2Bom5uoerW0xGagp6yVp7umwIywoK2gXaiyrrWMp6ydnV2ltbDAzmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
