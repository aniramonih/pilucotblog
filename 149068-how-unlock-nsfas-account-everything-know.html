The student would not be able to access their wallet or the cash to take or participate in the government <a href=#>loan or scholarship</a>.</p><h2>What causes the locking of the NSFAS account?</h2><p class=align-left>A significant mistake that causes the account locking is when a student incorrectly inputs their wallet password more than three times.

"So, what do I do if my NSFAS account is locked?" You may ask.
