While we love our current <a href=#>Queer Eye</a> crew (and can't wait for Season 5 on Netflix!), we have to give credit where credit it due: The OG <a href=#>Fab Five</a> who started the whole thing. Let's look into what exactly they're doing these days.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ted Allen</h2><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Ted Allen, who was the food and wine expert on Queer Eye, is now doing just that.

Most recently, he's been featured in the shows Eastsiders and Dollface. In 2017 he was in episodes of Grey's Anatomy and The Magicians, and before that, he was in How I Met Your Mother, Bones, and more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thom Filicia</h2><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Thom Felicia, interior designer on Queer Guy and IRL (he owns his own company, Thom Felicia Inc.), teamed up with former colleague Carson and launched the show Get a Room with Carson & Thom in 2018.
