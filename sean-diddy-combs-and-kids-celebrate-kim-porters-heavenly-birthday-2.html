Despite Diddy’s recent social media hiatus in light of <a href=#>sexual assault allegations</a>, he took to Instagram to express his love for the mother of four of his children.</p><p>Diddy’s Instagram post read, “We miss you so much Kim! Happy Birthday Beautiful! Love forever.”</p><p>Kim Porter’s children, Quincy Brown, King Combs, and twins D’Lila and Jessie Combs, also shared their heartfelt wishes for her.</p><p>Quincy Brown, Kim’s firstborn, wrote, “Happy Heavenly Birthday Mommy! You still riding shotgun with me till this day. I miss you more than the lord will allow! I love you Mommy!”</p><p>Christian, her second-born, added, “HAPPY HEAVENLY BIRTHDAY MOMMY!!!&nbsp; I wish I could be with you right now and hug you and give you love!!! I love you and miss you so much !!”</p><p>Finally, the Combs twins shared in their Instastories, “Happy Heavenly Birthday Queen. We love you so much. Everything we do is for you. We miss you so much, and we are always thinking about you.”</p><p>It has been five years since Kim Porter’s <a href=#>untimely passing</a> on November 15, 2018. An autopsy report, released two months after her tragic death, revealed that she succumbed to lobar pneumonia, a bacterial infection often set off by the flu or a virus.</p><p>The L.A. County Medical Examiner released a statement, stating, “On Nov. 16, 2018, an autopsy was performed on Porter, and a cause of death was deferred pending further investigation. It was later determined Porter died from lobar pneumonia. The manner of death was certified as natural.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/12/porter.jpg alt width=640 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shortly after her passing, Diddy wrote in a statement, &nbsp;“God broke the mold when he made Kim. There was truly no other woman like her. Although her time here on earth was far too short, she lived a life full of purpose and meaning. She was a loving mother and devoted friend.”</p><p>Porter and Diddy were never married, but shared four children— including Porter’s son with producer Al B. Sure, Quincy Brown, 32, who Combs adopted; Christian a.k.a King, 25; and twins D’Lila and Jessie, 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmampfZoRwv8SapWacmZmxunnCqKSbq12Wu6V5yqKbrGWTmrmmrtGaq55lm566brzOq6ueqqNitaat1Z6lpbFdl7azwMedmLJlYmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
