Everyone keeps asking how it feels to be a dad. Anyone can make a baby, but going through the day-to-day process of being a father is going to be a new experience. I’m very happy, very honored and very privileged and I want to make sure I do my absolute best for Pierre.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Karine-Paul-Staehle-Baby-Pierre-Martins-Staehle.jpg><p>Karine, 23, added: “I am fine, and happy, even with the hard time I have had. And I am recovering well, but I am still very weak. It was super hard, but now everything is fine because the baby is calm and he is breastfeeding well.”</p><p>The reality star couple confirmed that they had a little one on the way in October 2018. The news came after Karine suffered two miscarriages, one of which was documented on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days.</p><p>“The first miscarriage was very early on,” <a href=#>Paul told Us&nbsp;exclusively</a> in November 2018. “We weren’t really that attached. Right after that second miscarriage went through, we got pregnant again. It was like, boom, boom. That was the one everyone saw on TV.”</p><p>The dad-to-be added: “The next pregnancy, she was actually prescribed birth control, and she was taking a supplement to feel better. We were supposed to wait six months to a year. So, we were gonna wait, give it time in regards to that. We’ve actually heard things where if we had the baby within six months it’s actually better. I was like, OK, whenever you’re ready. She got pregnant within a few months. She was in denial.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Kentucky native also admitted he took issue with the name Karine had picked out, Pierre. “The initials, I don’t like,” Paul told Us. “The initials she wants are ‘PMS.’ She doesn’t get why it’s bad. It’s not gonna be good. I was bullied all my life. It’s not good initials.”</p><p>Paul showed off his wife’s baby bump in February when the mom-to-be searched for sea shells at the beach, <a href=#>her budding belly on full display in a bikini</a>. He also shared footage with fans from their ultrasound appointment, as well as a few videos of Pierre kicking in Karine’s stomach on Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqxrdSlZJqmlGK4or7Ip5xmq6SWsqm4xGaunqSTpLqmecBmmZqaqWKvsMWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
