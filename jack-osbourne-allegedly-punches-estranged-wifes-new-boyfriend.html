According to court documents obtained by Us, Lisa is seeking joint and physical custody of their three daughters: Pearl, 6, Andy, 3, and Minnie, 5 months. She has also requested spousal support.</p><p>“The news about us separating has probably come as a bit of a shock to everyone,” the estranged couple later said in a statement shared on the Osbournes alum’s Instagram page. “But, we just want to clear the air and share with you what’s going on. So, first and foremost, we absolutely still love each other. Our family is the most important thing in our lives, and we tried everything we could for many years to make this work. What’s best for our family right now is that we separate lovingly, and remain best friends who are committed to raising our children together.”</p><p>A month later, Jack <a href=#>opened up about his new family dynamic</a>. “Things are going good,” he told Us on June 12. “We’re trucking along, and it is what it is.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Jack’s rep for comment.</p><p>For the latest beauty and style trends subscribe to our new podcast ‘Get Tressed With Us’ below!<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZOgerC%2Fwaisq6aVYq6tuMSgnJ2kqWK9trrCoZysZZWowbOtzaCcnWWnnrOmv4ynnLBlkqTGp77InqWdZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
