Only, when you start dating somebody else, even though they’re great, deep down you know you’re just not ready for that ‘somebody new.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/0A4111BA-B6F0-4EE0-8EB1-A061A542B31A-1024x683.jpg><p>Described as an inspiring and energetic tune for anyone going through a rough solo patch and excited to find love after heartbreak, Moreno tells us that while he did plan to release it eventually, the real reason why its his latest release is because of his loyal fanbase.</p><p>“My fans actually chose this song for me to record,” he shares. “I do live streams every week since COVID started, and this song was a fan favorite over and over. That is how and why I chose to record [‘Somebody New’].”</p><p><span>Chris Moreno is a Nashville recording artist that has been making waves in Music City with his songs like “Before You” and “Used To This.” Known for having an honest sound with sincere delivery, Moreno has developed an extremely loyal fan base and has performed at over 500 shows in 20 different states, both acoustically and with his band.</span></p><p><span>Chris has worked with Nashville producers Jonathan Roye (Kelsea Ballerini) and also Justin Wantz and continues to tour and put out a steady stream of new music.</span> <span>His music mixes elements of a modern country sound with a noticeable Pop/Rock edge, and he brazenly wears the alternative rock influences of the 90’s and 2000’s on his sleeve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Moreno’s accolades include a nomination for Best Country Artist two years in a row by the New England & Boston Music Awards, as well as best songwriter, and for best song (“Before You”).&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4760-1024x1024.jpg><p>“Somebody New” is the first taste of Chris’ new music, which he confirms will be coming later this year. With another single slated for an April release, Moreno shares that fans should be on the lookout for some music videos — including one for “Somebody New” — along with an EP.</p><p>Listen to “Somebody New” below and let us know what you think of the song by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sending us a tweet at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Chris by following him on Instagram at <a href=#>@chrismorenomusic</a>.</p><p></p><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_juliet has-avatar"><img decoding=async data-expand=600 width=80 height=80 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/17308999_10212396175003763_1181666831096569491_n-110x110.jpg alt="Juliet Schroder" data-sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Juliet is the founder and executive producer/host of Celeb Secrets and Celeb Secrets Country.
