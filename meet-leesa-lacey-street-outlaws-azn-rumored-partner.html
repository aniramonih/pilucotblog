Who is she? What does she do for a living? Are they really a couple?</p><p>Learn all about her in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Leesa Lacey, Street Outlaws Star AZN Rumored Partner</strong></h3><p>Street Outlaws star Jeffery Bonnett AKA AZN is reportedly in a long-term relationship with his rumored partner Leesa Lacey. They have reportedly known each other for more than 18 years. Though they are not married, they are closer than more than half of married couples out there.</p><p>Leesa is rumored to be married to someone else, thus the specifics of this possible relationship seem suspect. Despite the fact that this may all appear improbable, AZN is mentioned in her social media posts. He is shown with two dogs in the photograph she posted below.</p><p>“Kids were so happy daddy Jeff Bonnett is home,” Lessa shared while suggesting that she and AZN owned dogs together.</p><p>Contrarily, she also occasionally posts images with a man by the name of Luis Renova, who she appears to be very into. Additionally, Luis and AZN have occasionally been spotted together. Luis is a dad to two beautiful teen daughters. In November 2020, Leesa posted on <a href=#>Facebook</a>, “Thank you for sharing your girls with me:)… <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv x1qq9wsj xo1l8bm" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=xt0psk2>Luis Renova</span></a><span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">.”</span></p><p>Later in November 2020 post, Leesa <a href=#>posted</a>, “I love you <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv x1qq9wsj xo1l8bm" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=xt0psk2>Luis Renova</span></a>!!!!!!:” Luis and Leesa have also known each other for a long time. The biggest indication, however, that AZN and Leesa might be having a relationship comes from a picture of the two on Facebook.</p><p>Luis is a media marketing director at&nbsp;<span class=xt0psk2>Farmtruck and AZN. Luis is also an owner-operator at Lou 405 Photo. Moreover, Luis has also worked in Marketing and media at&nbsp;Pimp Juice Traction Compound.</span></p><p>Leesa describes AZN as her “ride or die” in the caption, noting that they met 17 years ago in August 2021. She adds a heart emoji as well. But the relationship between Lessa and AZN is likely limited to just being friends.</p><p>As AZN’s FB relationship status reveals, he is “single.”</p><p>Talking about AZN, he is 41 years old being born on 3 August 1981. He studied Psychology at Oklahoma City Community College. According to his Street Outlaws bio, AZN is Farmtruck’s sidekick. For the past few years, AZN has been the one to handle the smack talk while Farmtruck wins the races. AZN will always stand by Farmtrucks’ side but recently he’s been looking to get behind the wheel of his own ride.</p><p>After a failed attempt at racing lawnmowers it looks like AZN may have found a new sleeper to call his own. “The Dung Beetle,” a Volkswagen Beetle that looks like ‘Dung’ on the outside, but underneath the hood is a 1000HP Turbo-charged precision engine. Together with the Farmtruck, The Dung Beetle is gonna feast on unsuspecting racers as well as the other drivers on “The List.”</p><h3><strong>Leesa Lacey Age</strong></h3><p>Leesa Lacey is currently 60 years old.
