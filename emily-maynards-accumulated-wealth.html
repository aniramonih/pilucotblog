Her involvement in the entertainment industry since 2011 has significantly contributed to her net worth.</p><p>Emily Maynard’s net worth is estimated to be around $5 million, solidifying her status as a prominent figure in the entertainment domain. Her assets include a luxurious 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom residence in Charlotte, North Carolina, valued at $450,000.</p><h3>Emily Maynard’s Current Net Worth: $5 Million</h3><p>Emily Maynard first gained public attention in 2004 due to unfortunate circumstances, as her fiancé, NASCAR owner and race car driver Ricky Hendrick, passed away in a plane crash. She was just 15 years old when they began dating, and six months prior to his death, they got engaged. A week after his death, she discovered that she was expecting their daughter, whom she named Josephine Riddick Hendrick. Following this, she stayed out of the public eye for some time.</p><p>In 2011, Emily Maynard made her television debut in the reality TV series “The Bachelor“ (2011) on ABC. Entrepreneur Brad Womack, the show’s ‘bachelor,’ chose Emily over other finalists. Despite seeming content together, they remained close friends due to unfavorable circumstances. However, these TV appearances contributed to Emily’s net worth.</p><p>In 2012, Maynard assumed the lead role in another reality show “The Bachelorette“ (2012), engaging with 25 selected men. The series culminated with 27-year-old entrepreneur Jef Holm winning her heart. Nevertheless, reports of Emily Maynard and Jef Holm parting ways surfaced in 2012. Once again, these TV stints reinforced her net worth.</p><p>Delving into Emily Maynard’s personal life, it’s worth mentioning that she married Tyler Johnson in 2014, and they have a son. They currently reside in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Emily Maynard Johnson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1 February 1986</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Morgantown, West Virginia USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>163 cm</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>TV personality</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Tyler Johnson (2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/OfficialEmilyMaynard</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/emilymaynard</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm2915891</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Bachelor (2011), The Bachelorette (2012)</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Gave birth to her 3rd child at age 30, a son named Gibson Kyle Johnson on September 16, 2016.
