So, in this blog, we discuss the death rumors and other tragedies in the show.</p><h2><strong>Who died in American Pickers?</strong></h2><p>After ten years of working with Mike, Frank Fritz has finally left the show for good. Since fans hadn’t seen him for a very long time, many started to wonder if the death rumors were actually true. Are they? Let’s find out.</p><p>Frank Fritz is not dead. However, he did have a major accident two years before, which severely injured his back. This led him to be hospitalized for more than 24 months.</p><p>The doctors had to install two rods in Frank’s spine and give him 185 stitches. Following the injury, Frank was out of the show for more than two years, which led fans to believe something was wrong.</p><p>Before 2021, nobody had confirmed the wellness of Frank. However, we’ve recently received the announcement that the co-host will leave the show for good.</p><p>In an interview, Mike mentioned that Frank had a serious problem with drinking. That is also partly why he was unable to recover for so long. In reply, Frank assured them he wasn’t an alcoholic anymore.
