Start time for the memorial service is 6:00 p.m. On Friday, May 18th, 2012, at The Red Dirt Pavilion on Pecan Street in Buffalo Gap, Reverends Rex Mauldin and Norman Patton will preside. The arrangements have been entrusted to Starbuck Funeral Home.</p><p>The funeral will be followed by a final pickin in true Stan fashion, so friends are encouraged to bring lawn chairs and join in the celebration of Stan’s life and love of music. Stan graduated from Trent High School in 1969. He was born on February 15, 1951, in Merkel, Texas. In 1969 and 1970, he was a member of the University of Texas football teams that won the NCAA national championship.</p><p>Stan wed an Abilene native named Renee Rackow in 1971. After moving to Nashville, Stan pursued a career as a musician, performing with such legends as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Music was still the driving force in Stan’s life. He was well-known for his “pickins,” or intimate gatherings with his preferred performers. On his final Friday night, he did just that at the Buffalo Gap Community Center, surrounded by great country music, delicious BBQ, and loving friends and family.</p><p>Stan’s final song, “Silver Wings,” was a touching tribute to his loved ones. The Red Dirt Pavilion will continue playing his songs as a tribute to him. After twenty years of teaching and coaching at AISD’s Madison Middle School, where he had the chance to influence the lives of numerous students, Stan announced his retirement at the end of May.</p><p>Survivors include his wife, Renee Hicks of Trent; his mother, Rojean Freeman Hicks of Trent; three sons, Bradley Hick and wife Heather of Buffalo Gap, Wesley Hicks of Weatherford and Thomas Hicks and wife Britni of Abilene; his sisters, Debi Weaver and husband John of Arlington; Tammie Spitler and husband Dennis of Abilene; four grandchildren, Kayla, Kelsy, Trey and Layton; and many aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpww8SsZKGhk6DAbrvBoquumaKueqPBxZ%2BYpaddnK6xedOer5qrXayytHnHopqkq12drrR5w6KcnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
