The politician has been married twice and Makenze is his second.</p><p>She is a 2015 Western Kentucky University alumni and is a fifth-grade teacher in Oldham County, Kentucky. On July 31, 2020, the couple exchanged their vows at a small private outdoor ceremony. Following their wedding, the presence of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel on their wedding ignited the rumors that McConnell and Cameron’s wife are related.</p><p>Later, Elizabeth Kuhn, Cameron’s spokeswoman, confirmed that the rumors suggesting a family connection between Cameron’s wife and the senator are “false.” In addition to that, their love and married life have been kept private as of now and therefore, not much is known about how the couple first met.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m running for Governor because I believe every Kentuckian deserves the opportunity to pave a better path forward for themselves, and for their family.</p><p>Kentuckians are ready for Bold Conservative Leadership.

He previously got married to Elizabeth Cameron in 2016. Their married life only lasted for a year, ending in 2017. However, the reason for their separation has not been disclosed to the media.</p><p>Cameron and Evans share one son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8%2BepqmklWSxorrInqNmm5GisrO7zWauop6VYrqit8SnsZ5llauur7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
