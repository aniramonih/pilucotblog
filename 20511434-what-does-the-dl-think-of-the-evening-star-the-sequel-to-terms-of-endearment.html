I guess it is a curiosity piece? The book was followed fairly well, but there isn't as much character development in the film compared with the original.</p><p>Nicholson had one scene. Richardson was excellent, and I liked Marion Ross as the housekeeper. Patsy and the housekeeper were much more prominent than in the original.</p><p>I'm not sure making The Evening Star was necessary, considering how iconic Terms was.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 5</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 28, 2018 2:26 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Someone give my sequel a shot!</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 6</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 28, 2018 2:29 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>The house they chose in this house turned out to be owned by the daughter of the woman whose house they used in the original!</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 7</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 28, 2018 2:32 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>A big disappointment, but to be fair, the novel was too.</p><p>Miranda Richardson was way over the top with accent and performance. Juliette Lewis wasn’t much better.</p><p>Marion Ross wanted that nomination so bad. I remember an interview she did where the reporter dangled the possibility of a nomination in front of her, and her eyes filled with tears.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 8</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 28, 2018 2:40 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Complete waste of time and effort for all parties involved. You ache for Debra Winger the entire time. Without the character of Emma as her loving foil, Aurora is overexposed in this misbegotten sequel. Terms is perfection. Best left at that.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 9</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 28, 2018 5:28 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>The book was great, I love McMurtry, the movie...meh.

The second half begins well, then they start rushing through all these years to clearly produce a kind of similar end to the first film.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 14</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 30, 2018 12:00 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>r12 Yeah I think he is mentioned in passing like the one kid grew up with him and he may ask the girl if she's talked to him but the kids are grown now.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 15</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 30, 2018 12:08 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I watched it again recently after 20 years and enjoyed it more than I would've guessed. Solid performances, and the idea of Aurora having a late in life second adolescence is pleasant enough, but the film makes a number of near-fatal errors.</p><p>Having Nicholson for only an extended cameo was idiotic. His character may not have been in either McMurtry novel, but he was necessary. Part of what dulled the sadness of "Terms" was the notion that Aurora had found love and that he would help her cope with her daughter's death and raise her grandchildren. "Evening Star" obliterated that comfort and befouled its predecessor.</p><p>The film was a also a bloodbath. The body count is staggering; there are THREE deaths by the end! It's overkill (pun intended) and I think it was a mistake to let Aurora die at the end just for maudlin sentiment.</p><p>It's not the worst film ever, but it's a sequel that did not need to be made.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 16</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 30, 2018 1:17 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Flap is missing from both the novel and the film. He turned out to be a deadbeat dad...not exactly shocking.</p><p>Not a fan of this film but didn’t hate it like I hated another McMurtry sequel, Texasville.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 17</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 30, 2018 2:19 AM</span></td></tr></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3TmqOorZ6csm%2BvzqZmraCimq6le5FpbGppZGiBbsPHmqtmnJ%2BawG7Ax55knaRdqbWquspmpp9lpJ2ybrHVnqWippdiwLWt0WaroZ1dqLKywcSlZK2nXamys7nSZqafZZWjsaat0aacp6xd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
