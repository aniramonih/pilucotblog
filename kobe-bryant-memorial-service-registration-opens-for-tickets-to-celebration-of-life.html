The date is meaningful: Gianna wore No. 2 on her youth basketball teams, and Kobe wore No. 24 in his NBA career. Vanessa, 37, also pointed out that 20 is the number of years Kobe played for the Lakers and the number of years he and Vanessa were married.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kobe-Bryant-Memorial-Service.jpg><p>Vanessa revealed via Instagram on Thursday, February 13, that Kobe’s Mamba Sports Foundation <a href=#>will now be called the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation</a> “because there is no #24 without #2,” she wrote.</p><p>Kobe and Gianna were <a href=#>laid to rest in a private service</a> in Corona Del Mar, California, on February 7. John, Keri and Alyssa Altobelli — who also perished in the wreck — were <a href=#>remembered at a service at Angel Stadium</a> in Anaheim, California, on Monday, February 10.</p><p>Vanessa — who also shared Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months, with the five-time NBA champ — first <a href=#>opened up about her grief</a> on Instagram on January 29. “There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved,” she wrote at the time. “We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp5KaeqO%2B2JqlrWWdmrqwvsiao2arlafDqq%2FEZqmen5mowbOt06Kmp2WfpbKvv4yfpqtlpJ6wrLHTrGStp12Ysq2xwauYraGfo3qwsoyloJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
