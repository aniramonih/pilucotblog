Not necessarily a show that will go down in history as one of the most groundbreaking of all time, but plenty of solid matches, story progression, and <a href=#>even a title change</a>. Someone who didn't lose their title was Rhea Ripley, successfully defending the Women's World Championship against Raquel Rodriguez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-homage-to-chyna>An Homage To Chyna</h2><p>Ripley looked good doing it too, as has been pointed out by many fans since the match, and there's a very good reason for that. The Nightmare chose to pay homage to someone whose footsteps she is very much following through her ring gear, Chyna. Not only was Ripley's black leather studded gear at Payback reminiscent of the in-ring outfit Chyna might well be most synonymous with, but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was the exact same outfit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Trish Stratus Shares Photo Showcasing The Aftermath Of Her Payback Cage Match</a></span></p><p>Not only does the pattern appear to be identical, but Ripley even has the same three straps going across her stomach. The only major difference between the two outfits is the shoulder straps. While Ripley's are made of the same material as the rest of the gear, Chyna's were made of metal chain links connected together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chyna-39-s-family-approves>Chyna's Family Approves</h2><p>The reactions to Ripley's homage have been mixed because, well, this is wrestling, and apparently even someone trying to pay tribute to a performer she loves is viewed as a bad thing by some people. A few fans saw it as an opportunity to let Ripley know they don't think she'll ever be on the same level as Chyna. Chyna's family, who continue to run the late Hall of Famer's Twitter account, let Ripley know that not only did they love it, but Chyna would have loved it too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ripley isn't the type of person to ever try and claim she's better than someone like Chyna, but it's natural to make comparisons between the two. Both are muscular women making a mark in an industry that has typically been dominated by men. Both have clashed with men in WWE too, as recently as Payback for Ripley. The Women's Champion speared Kevin Owens through the barricade, opening the door for her fellow Judgment Day members to become Tag Team Champions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeinbKiedGip6WdqWLEuLGMqZiympGYuG6zxJqpZpuYrruieceopJqflWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
