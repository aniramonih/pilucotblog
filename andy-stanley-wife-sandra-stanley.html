Ever since then, Sandra is living with her long-time husband, Andy, in Atlanta.</p><p>It has been over three decades since Andy Stanley and Sandra Stanley are together as husband and wife. And, their love for one another is still as strong as it was in the beginning. Unlike Andy’s parents, there does not seem to be any marital issues all through these years.

She was raising three little kids and homeschooling her eldest for Kindergarten. Moreover, Sandra was also juggling all the details of young family life, so she did not have a ton of margin for adding to-dos to the to-do list.</p><p>In the midst of that, members of their NPM <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">requested her</a> to be involved in its women’s ministry. However, she said no to their proposal as she had already said yes to homeschooling her son with Andy during that season. Sandra knew she could not do both well. So, she set aside time for what was important to her family, i.e., homeschooling.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=An_Advocate_And_Author></span>An Advocate And Author<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Besides being the founder and active member of the North Point Ministry, Sandra Stanley is also an advocate and foster mom for kids and fighting with the challenges of foster care. She is working in the foster care initiative developed by NPM called Fostering Together. Moreover, Sandra has even fostered children herself.</p><p>Everything began when Sandra and Andy’s youngest kid, Allison Stanley, entered ninth grade. The same year, Sandra and her husband became the foster family of three little girls. Although fostering those girls was challenging at first, every member of the Stanley family took out some time from their schedule to help the girls.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Sandra Stanley (@sandrawstanley)</a></p><p><br>Sandra’s sons, Garrett and Andrew, would drive the girls to school and help with some errands. Also, the boys provided as much laughter for the lives of the girls who never had brothers. Similarly, Sandra’s daughter, Allie, worked as a role model and assisted with child care. According to Sandra, the girls listened to Allie more than her even though they told the same things. In 2018, Sandra and her partner, Andy, fostered another girl too.</p><p>Apart from those all, Sandra Stanley is also an author. Some of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">books authored</a> by Sandra Stanley are Breathing Room and Comparison Trap. You can order her books to read them online or in a book through her website as well as other online sites, including thrift books and Amazon.</p><p>So, Andy Stanley’s wife, Sandra Stanley, has many work experiences to date, and she is happy with whatever she does. Besides, she is also a supportive wife and a great mom. We hope her relationship with her husband and kids remains as strong as it is now.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
