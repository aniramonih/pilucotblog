The Chilean-American star will next be seen in the highly anticipated premiering on Sunday, January 15.</p><p>The show, from creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, is considered one of the best video game adaptations of all time. While the star has received consistent praise for his acting chops, he is also adored for how tenderly he encouraged his sister when she came out as a transwoman. Let us meet Pedro Pascal's amazing activist sister who bravely embraced her identity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><h2 class=split>Who is Pedro Pascal's sister, Lux Pascal?</h2><p>On February 10, 2021, Pedro used Instagram to send his sister Lux love and blessings as she came out as a trans woman. The actor also posted a cover to the Spanish-language Ya magazine featuring Lux to show his affection and support for her. Lux is seen in the image flaunting a smoldering attitude and staring directly into the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Her famous brother sent her a beautiful note in Spanish. He wrote, “Mi Hermana, mi corazón, Nuestra Lux,” which means “My sister, my heart, our Lux.” Lux, who was formerly known as Lucas Balmaceda, confessed in the Ya cover story that she aspires to be an actress like her widely recognized brother and that she has started studying at the renowned Juilliard School in New York City to develop her craft. Lux made an appearance as a character named Elias in an episode of ‘Narcos', in which her big brother Pedro also starred.</p><h2 class=split>Lux insists her family is very supportive</h2><p>Lux Pascal proudly acknowledged that her entire family has been quite supportive of her transition, despite her initial worries that they wouldn't be. She said in the feature post, “My transition has been something that’s very natural for everyone in my family. It’s almost something that they expected to happen.” Lux acknowledged in the interview that she began hormone therapy in July 2020. She added that her brother Pedro has helped her transition the most.</p><p>Apart from being supportive of his sister, Pedro was reportedly 'a little worried' and was in touch with her continuously over video calls when he initially learned that she was transitioning, according to Lux. Later, the actor immediately congratulated Lux as she expressed her happiness after her transformation. "Perfect, this is incredible," Pedro reportedly told Lux. “He [Pedro] has been an important part of this. He is also an artist and has been a guide. He was one of the first to give me the things that formed my identity,” she added.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Pedro Pascal's sister is also an activist</h2><p>Lux revealed in the same post that she wants to provide the trans community with positive representation. She said, "Moving through the world as a woman is much more simple for me, but I still advocate for nonbinary identities to have a space in society.” About the fight against discrimination, she added, "We need trans activists who are good, smart, informed, and who can be strong voices against transphobia, homophobia, and racism.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKWssWWglsCkrctmpJ6dpGK9prDRqGSpmaOYrq2%2FjJqkmrKZo7RurcKtoK%2Bho6l6tLXSrZyr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
