He is not related to Lawrence in any way. He is not wanted on any charges and had nothing to do with the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala. The Bambiha gang has accused a Punjab gangster of being involved in Bishnoi’s murder, so we’ve been in touch with the Rajasthan Police to verify this. A gang of Rajasthanis were likely responsible for his death.”</p><h2><strong>Supari killer shot dead outside court in Rajasthan’s Nagaur</strong></h2><p>Police in the Nagaur district of Rajasthan have confirmed that a contract killer was killed by gunfire on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Sandeep Vishnoi is the paid assassin. Outside the courthouse, in full view of the police, the assailants opened fire on gangster Sandeep Vishnoi, killing him instantly.</p><p>According to the police, Sandeep Vishnoi was on his way to a hearing in a Nagur court when a car pulled up and unknown assailants opened fire, killing him instantly. Every single assailant drove a black Scorpio.</p><p>The incident brought out a large number of people, who gathered outside the courthouse. The hospital was rushed to receive Vishnoi’s corpse.</p><p>Barricades have been set up throughout the area, and police are inspecting every vehicle in an effort to apprehend the attackers.</p><p>“The decedent was a local of Haryana. Besides being a contract killer, he was also involved in smuggling booze across the border. Vishnoi had ties to the Sethi crew. In Nagaur, he had also killed a businessman. On the surface, it looks like a murder case, “an officer involved in the probe into the crime said.</p><h2><strong>Notorious Gangster Raju Fauji’s Special Friend</strong></h2><p>Smuggler Raju Fauji, who was responsible for the deaths of two Bhilwara police officers, counted Sandeep Vishnoi as a friend and associate. Sandeep supplied weapons used by Raju Fauji in the murder of the police officers. During police interrogation, Sandeep admitted that he had purchased weapons from an Uttar Pradesh supplier in order to maintain his gang’s operations.</p><p>Fauji is another well-known criminal. In 2016, Fauji aided Vishnoi while he was hiding out in Barmer. The two became fast friends after that. A police interrogation revealed that gangster Sandeep had supplied Raju Fauji with multiple firearms, including a revolver and a pistol. Sandeep had previously stated that he had not accepted payment from Fauji. Fauji stayed in Haryana with the constable’s killer after the murder.</p><p>On November 29, 2019, Sandeep Vishnoi was first mentioned in connection with a murder case in Nagaur. A woman was revealed to have planned a murder plot to avenge the death of her husband during interrogation. The woman had hired Sandeep Vishnoi to kill her husband and paid him Rs 30 lakh. The gangster was locked up for his role in this incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K4v46wn6hlmah6tK3NnZyeqF2XtrS0zaigaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
