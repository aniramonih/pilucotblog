Like heated seats, a heated steering wheel cover is a small accessory that can make a big difference in your comfort. It keeps your hands warm as you drive and makes a daily commute or road trip a far more pleasant experience in the winter months.</p><h2>What To Consider When Shopping For Heated Steering Wheel Covers</h2><p>When shopping for a heated steering wheel cover, it's a good idea to measure your steering wheel beforehand so you know exactly what size you need. Since steering wheel covers are designed to fit snugly, being off by even an inch could result in the cover having a poor fit with uneven heat or not fitting at all. (Although some online reviewers with oversize wheels noted that they'd had luck stretching out covers to fit.)</p><p>Also, be wary of steering wheel covers that are marketed as "self-warming." Unless it's electric with a cord that <a href=# class=T3D>plugs into the car's cigarette lighter adaptor</a>, it's not actually a heated cover.</p><h2>Shop The Best Heated Steering Wheel Covers</h2><p>In a hurry?
