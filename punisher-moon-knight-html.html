Fan Theory Explained</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>After much anticipation, Marvel’s&nbsp;Moon Knight&nbsp;finally debuted on Disney Plus on March 30, 2022.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>There are six episodes that last around 40 to 50 minutes each, and so far, four episodes have been released.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And as the series draws close to an end, netizens are debating how MCU will carry on its traditions of dropping Easter eggs and introducing cameos.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Netizens suspect that this time the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">cameo</a>&nbsp;might be made by one of the Midnight Sons members, aka Punisher. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Before the Disney Plus series release, there was an awful lot of talk surrounding the potential return of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Jon Bernthal</a>'s&nbsp;Punisher in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fan Theories on Punisher’s Return on Moon Knight</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The last time fans saw Punisher was in the Netflix series&nbsp;The Punisher,&nbsp;which got canceled after two seasons in 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>MCU often brings back characters such as Daredevil in&nbsp;Spider-Man No Way Home&nbsp;and Vincent D’Onofrio’s return as Kingpin in&nbsp;Hawkeye.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans have questioned why other characters haven’t gotten the same treatment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Punisher was popular with the critics and fans who have been dying to see him in the MCU since his departure.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, netizens have opined&nbsp;that there is a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">high possibility</a>&nbsp;that Punisher, aka Frank Castle, would be making a cameo.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Jon Bernthal as the Punisher set to make a cameo on Moon Knight. </strong>(Source: The Punisher/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Another reason fans are sure that Castle will be making a comeback is that he is no longer considered too violent for MCU.</p><p>Marvel has a PG-13 rating that spans the whole MCU, and because of the violent nature of Bernthal’s character, fans didn’t think he would be reprising his role.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Even Bernthal noted he would only be back if he were allowed to preserve the character’s vicious nature.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But recently, though, Marvel has been changing its rules.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marvel Making Room for Darker Characters</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The production house integrated violent characters like Moon Knight and Blade into the MCU, which means excluding Punisher for being violent makes no more sense.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>No Way Home&nbsp;brought back Daredevil and&nbsp;Hawkeye&nbsp;Kingpin, and although these characters are not as vicious as Punisher, they are still much more villainous than the average MCU character.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And some characters are way worse than Punisher, like Moon Knight, who has earned an individual project for phase 4. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This shows that Marvel is ready to make room for darker characters.&nbsp;</p><p>However, users on Reddit had different opinions.</p><p>They said that a Castle cameo was unlikely because Punisher and Moon Knight had no special connection, despite crossing paths in the comics.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>One user commented that there wasn’t any reason for the two anti-heroes to meet because, in the new Disney Plus series, it did not seem like there would be a situation in this show that called for them butting heads.</p><p>Another user commented that bringing back agent Dinah Madani made more sense, as she could be called upon to investigate weird occurrences in the region.</p><p>Fans will have to wait and see if Castle will make a cameo as there is no way to confirm any of it beforehand. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKilo7a0tMSrZKann6N6rLrIoJ%2BtZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
