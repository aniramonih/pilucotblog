He's a funny little boy. I don't know, I really don't know. He really loves girls, he doesn't really like boys, as in playing with boys, and he's going to an all-boys school which is a bit worrying."</p><p id=eT9L-6rCPDaU data-wc=99>She added: "And he loves dressing up, he wears a dress every day, I'm not revealing anything, I just think he is the most different… I've never met a child like him. So he is theatrical, interesting, totally like a little girl, and it's so funny because he and Buddy get on really well but Buddy is a real boy and he is like a little girl, but a boy so I don't know. I have no idea. I just hope they have Frozen dresses in the dress up box, in an all-boys school. He is just a character."</p><p id=eL07V1Mgapyf data-wc=56>Sharing her nerves with both Zoe and Georgia, she continued: "He is quite OK to leave me, and he is good with other people so we'll just see. I just don't know, it could go either way and I'm thinking: 'I am so worried,' I just really want him to enjoy it so I can relax."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
