In a new preview from the upcoming season of TLC’s Kate Plus 8, family matriarch <strong>Kate Gosselin</strong> dives <a href=#>back into the dating pool</a> as she manages a household filled with kids.</p><p>In the new season of the show, school is out and summer has arrived. For the several months ahead, the single mom of eight <a href=#>has numerous activities and trips</a> in mind for her kids — <strong>Cara, Madelyn, Alexis, Hannah, Aaden, Collin, Leah</strong>, and<strong> Joel</strong> — including a family vacation down to Florida.</p><p>Their getaway includes a first-time excursion to a water park, deep-sea fishing, and a panic room scenario that will help the family execute decisions in sync — or fall apart in, well, panic.

In one scene, Kate also tries preventing the girls from going out with a few teenage boys.</p><p>While the busy mom spends the majority of her time tending to the kids, she considers dipping back into the dating pool — and with a cute guy, too. “This is your first blind date,” someone remarks. Kate seems to like this gentlemen, who whisks her through NYC in a limo and a romantic helicopter ride. (Sigh.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>How does the night conclude? “Yeah, I don’t know. What is the proper end-of-date goodnight?” she says. “I don’t know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>By the way, she didn’t tell her kids she was dating again.</p><p>Watch the preview above, and tune in to the premiere on TLC on Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdqb%2BqsdJmm5qsmaO0bsPEmqmsZaOgtq682GaZoqOZo7Zutc1mopqslWK9rcHSZm9mamBmgnJ%2BkGpm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
