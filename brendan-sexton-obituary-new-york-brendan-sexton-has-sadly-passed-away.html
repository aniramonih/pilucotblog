Brendan John Sexton, a stalwart figure of 78 years, bid farewell on November 14, 2023, succumbing to a prolonged illness. Born on June 29, 1945, in Detroit, Michigan, Brendan’s legacy transcends his birthplace and resonates deeply within the fabric of the city he called home.</p><p>Brendan’s imprint on New York City is indelible, most prominently as the former NYC Sanitation Commissioner. His groundbreaking initiatives transformed the cityscape, introducing curbside recycling and breaking gender barriers by hiring the first uniformed women sanitation workers in the metropolis. His dedication to public service and community action was not just a professional role but a lifelong commitment.</p><p>The obituary paints a vivid picture of Brendan’s multifaceted character — a man characterized by remarkable compassion, intelligence, and unparalleled accomplishment. He wasn’t merely a public servant; he was a beacon of civic duty, a champion for the City of New York. His life’s work is a testament to the profound impact an individual can have when driven by a genuine desire to serve the community. In the intimate realm of Sullivan Street, Brendan was more than a figurehead; he was a great man, a fantastic father, a wonderful husband, and an epic neighbor.</p><p>The loss is not confined to the public sphere; it reverberates through the close-knit community he called his forever home. As Sullivan Street grapples with this irreplaceable void, it is evident that Brendan John Sexton’s legacy is etched not only in the policies he shaped but in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to share the same sidewalks and stories on the storied streets of New York City. Pouring one out for Brendan is not just a toast; it’s a tribute to a life extraordinarily lived and a legacy that will forever echo through the cityscape he helped mold.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrtGepZ2ZnmLApsTTqKVmp5Kewbat0bJkp52nYsawvspmmaudnpmur3nSnq%2Btp55itaK%2FjKyYnaSpYr2iv9Kem2aZp5bGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
