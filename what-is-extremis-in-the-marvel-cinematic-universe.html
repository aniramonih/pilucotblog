But what exactly is Extremis?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-extremis data-injectable=false>What is Extremis?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/extremis.png><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>Extremis is a nanotech-enabled virus created by genetic biologist Maya Hansen, who was later enlisted by Aldrich Killian to perfect its stability under the eye of his A.I.M. agency. The virus enhances the subject’s DNA, specifically targeting the brain’s bodily repair functions and subsequently allowing the subjects to heal from most all wounds, and even regrow lost limbs and body parts. Some users are even able to manipulate the metabolic nature of the virus’ repairing ability to generate dangerous amounts of heat, which can lead to the creation of explosions if channeled properly.</p><p data-characters=644 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>Killian intended to use the virus to create an army of Extremis Soldiers, who were later wiped out by Iron Man, War Machine, and J.A.R.V.I.S. in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man 3</a> after Maya witnessed the horrors of Extremis experimentation behind A.I.M.’s doors and turned to Tony Stark for help. The virus was later acquired by HYDRA’s Centipede Project, where it was combined with Gamma Radiation, Chitauri technology, and a type of Super Soldier Serum to create their own breed of enhanced soldiers. Thanks to the efforts of Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, and the latter’s team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, the Centipede Project has since been extinguished.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>It’s no surprise that Gravik wishes to arm his Skrull warriors with the gifts of Extremis, then; having elite alien soldiers on your side is one thing, but elite alien soldiers that can cause explosions with their bare hands whilst being unfairly difficult to kill? Well, we can only hope that Fury manages to foil Gravik’s plans before it comes to that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnEsaurnZ2ewG61zWaroZ1doq6zwsSlZJyhnpq6osDInGSuppmrsrO%2FxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
