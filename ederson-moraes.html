His departure from Brazil came on the back of his disappointment release from youth academy of&nbsp;São Paulo FC. However, he had managed to impress his coaches enough to secure a move through Jorge Mendes’s agency. Once in Portugal, he took some time to find his feet. He eventually delivered sufficiently consistent performances to secure a move to Benfica FC. He earned his breakthrough in the 2nd season at the club with 38 appearances in the season. By that time, he had caught the attention of <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Pep Guardiola</a> who was adamant that his team would build attacks from the back. The transfer proved to be beneficial for all the parties involved as Manchester City won the domestic title with record-breaking points haul.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Ederson Santana de Moraes</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>The Bull</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ederson-as-seen-in-October-2018.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Leo</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Osasco, Sao Paulo, Brazil</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=Brazilian src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brazil.png alt=Brazilian width=64 height=46 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><h3>Education</h3><p>Ederson started his soccer journey with the youth setup of his&nbsp;local club,&nbsp;<strong>São Paulo FC</strong>.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Soccer Player</p><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father – </strong>Antonis Moraes (He stacked&nbsp;fruit onto lorries in Osasco.)</li><li><strong>Mother –&nbsp;</strong>Joelma</li></ul><h3>Manager</h3><p>Ederson is represented by Jorge Mendes’s agency, GestiFute.</p><h3>Position</h3><p>Goalkeeper</p><h3>Shirt Number</h3><p>93 –&nbsp;Rio Ave FC</p><p>1 – SL Benfica</p><p>31 – Manchester City</p><p>12, 23 – Brazil National Team</p><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>6&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in or 188 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>83 kg or 183 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Ederson has dated –</p><li><strong>Lais Moraes</strong> (2014-Present) – In April 2014, Ederson got married to&nbsp;Lais Moraes after they had been dating for a long time.

He followed in the footsteps of his older brother to join the club.</li><li>He was recommended to the youth setup of&nbsp;São Paulo by&nbsp;Gilberto Lopes, better known as Giba, who was his coach at&nbsp;Champions Ebenézer FC. Eventually, he joined the under-13 team at&nbsp;São Paulo.</li><li>Despite impressing his coaches at&nbsp;São Paulo, they decided against retaining him and he resumed his training at his former club.</li><li>However, he got his big break after Jorge Mendes’s associate asked&nbsp;Antonio Rodrigues, Ederson’s former coach, to recommend a promising goalkeeper. Rodrigues didn’t hesitate in naming Ederson and he got his move to Portugal.</li><li>In June 2015, he moved to Benfica from Rio Ave. Despite the transfer, Rio Ave got to keep 50% of his economic rights.</li><li>He signed an official contract with the Portuguese club in July 2015. As per the agreement, his release clause was set at&nbsp;€45 million.</li><li>During his stay at Benfica, he managed to win 2 Primeira Liga titles. He also won a&nbsp;Taça de Portugal and&nbsp;Taça da Liga.</li><li>In June 2017, Manchester City decided to pay&nbsp;£35 million (€40 million) as Pep Guardiola sought to replace error-prone&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Claudio Bravo</a> between the sticks.</li><li>He suffered a facial injury in September 2017 in a match against Liverpool. He was accidentally kicked in the face by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sadio Mane</a>. He had to be withdrawn from the match despite receiving a treatment for 8 minutes.</li><li>Mane was shown a straight red card by the referee and was handed a 3-match ban. Ederson had to get 8 stitches on his face.</li><li>However, the serious nature of the injury didn’t keep him out for long and he returned to the starting line up the following week for a Champions League match against Feyenoord. To protect his face, he had opted to wear a protective headgear.</li><li>In August 2018, he became the first goalkeeper in the Premier League history of Manchester City to record an assist. His long ball was pounced on by&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sergio Agüero</a> to score the 1st goal in a 6-1 win over&nbsp;Huddersfield Town.</li><li>In 2016, he was included in&nbsp;Brazil’s provisional squad for&nbsp;Copa América Centenario. However, he was later spared from joining the squad because of an injury.</li><li>In 2016, he got his&nbsp;Portuguese citizenship which made him eligible for the Portuguese national team but he decided to stick with Brazil.</li><li>Follow Ederson Moraes on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Ederson Moraes / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp6bnqqjpLtuuc6rmJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
