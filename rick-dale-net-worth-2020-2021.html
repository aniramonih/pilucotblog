Changing one’s field to transfer into something which can be unknown to them is a daunting task. It is a task which very few people have been able to manage. One such person is none other than Rick Dale.</p><p>Maybe you know about Rick Dale very well But do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Rick Dale’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Rick Dale spent the early years of his life under the name Richard James Dale. He was born in the year 1970, on the 13th of December. He is of Caucasian origin and holds American citizenship. He is the older of two children, often citing his brother, by the name of Ron Dale, to be quite unmanageable.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 13 December 1970, Rick Dale is 53 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.81m tall, and weight is 75 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Rick started his career as a singer for a metal band. His expertise as an antiques collector and restorer was quite undermined. His abilities were discovered when History Channel hired him to be the face of their show called American Restoration. After getting such a chance, Rick refused to look behind. He managed to amass a significant following due to the show. Moreover, his performance in the show was praised, as well as his expert opinion, which was deemed to be extremely valuable to this line of work.</p><p>He was the star of American Restoration for about six seasons, from the very first season of the show till its sixth season. After this, Rick Dale and his family were released by the upper echelons of History Channel since they decided that the show needed a revamp. After this, a new format was given to the show, along with an original cast. In real life, Rick Dale is the proud owner of an antique restoration facility called Rick Restorations, which is in the city of Las Vegas. This is the institution which was prominently featured in the show American Restorations.</p><p>From the end of October 2010, his show started being shown on History Channel, which provided a massive increment to the popularity of Rick Dale. Dale, by himself, was garnering quite a bit of reputation on his own. However, his antique restoration premises gained its real fame after being shown by the History Channel. The show was aired as a spin-off of the hugely successful show called Pawn Stars. After the sixth season, Rick and his family were replaced by other stars such as Steve Hale, Dave Walksler, Bob Halliday and a few others. The show, airing since the beginning of 2016, now has an entirely different format as well.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>Rick Harrison of Pawn Stars, one of the biggest shows on History Channel, has called Rick Dale a “miracle worker”. This is probably due to their time spent together before the spin-off show started airing. It is high praise from a real expert in the field. Rick Dale’s show has aired in over ten different countries, albeit with a different title. In other countries, the show is run under the name Kinds of Restoration.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Rick Dale in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rick-Dale-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Considering the proceeds from the show, and Rick’s general work as a restorer of antiques, it is no surprise to know that Rick is worth around a huge $4 million as of July 2024.</p><p>Rick Dale has forged his place not only in music but also in antique restoration and expertise, being a master of both trades.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZL%2Bqr8pmm5qklWK7psCMsKarrJhif3F%2Bj2ZpaWphZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
