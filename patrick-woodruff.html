He has been working there since 2019. Before that, he worked at Bank OZK for seven years. He had nearly twenty years of experience in banking and was an expert in commercial lending. He earned his bachelor’s degree of Bachelors of Business Administration in 2004 from the University of Arkansas.</p><p>He was the Founder of The Miller McNeil Woodruff Foundation, also known as ‘I am with Miller’. He founded this charitable organization after the death of his newborn son Miller, who lived for only 87 days. He was born with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and did not survive. He, along with his wife, founded the organization to help support other families who are going through the challenges his family faced and to raise awareness about SMA.</p><p>He was loved and respected by everyone who knew him. His colleagues had nothing but respect for him. He would spread laughter and joy with his sense of humor and impress anyone with his charismatic personality. He lived his life as a beacon of positivity. Tragically, his life was cut short by an accident.</p><h2>What happened to Patrick Woodruff?</h2><p>Patrick Woodruff was golfing at Pinnacle Country Club when tragedy struck him.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Patrick’s family and friends during this difficult time.</p><p>Patrick was a valued member of the Encore family, serving as a Commercial Relationship Manager in our Rogers office since November of 2019.
