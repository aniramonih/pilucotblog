Tragically, she used a gun she had purchased nine days earlier to shoot them.</p><p>In the subsequent harrowing events, Castro summoned help by calling 911 and bravely identifying her mother as the assailant.

The harrowing incident became the topic of headlines; everybody was shocked to hear that a mother killed her daughters.</p><p>During the trial, Youngblood pleaded not guilty because of insanity. The defense raised distressing allegations about her upbringing in Argentina, suggesting that she had been subjected to physical and even s*xual abuse by relatives.</p><p>During the proceedings, jurors were exposed to shocking revelations, one of which came from Veronica’s sister, Maria Kaczuba. Maria disclosed to the court that their family practiced Umbanda, a religion whose followers believe in the ability to communicate with the deceased.</p><p>Throughout the hearing, Ron, who had served overseas during their relationship, sat in court while Veronica testified, blaming him for their daughter’s tragic loss. Ron Youngblood also testified, expressing his deep pain and anguish from losing his precious daughters.</p><p>Ultimately, the jurors delivered a conviction on Wednesday, finding Youngblood guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and felony firearm use.</p><p>The sentence handed down was a maximum of 78 years in prison, with 36 years given for each of the first-degree murder charges and an additional three years for each firearm use count.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Veronica Youngblood with her daughters" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Veronica-Youngblood-with-her-daughters.webp alt="Veronica Youngblood with her daughters" width=400 height=587 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Veronica Youngblood Family Background</strong></h2><p>In 1985, Veronica Youngblood (age 38)was born in Argentina. Not much is known about her family, although we learned she has a sister named Kaczuba. Veronica spent her childhood in poverty and claimed that she suffered physical and s*xual abuse as a child.</p><p>She was only 16 when she became a mother and gave birth to her daughter, Sharon Castro. She had no job to feed her daughter, so she started working as a s*x worker.</p><p>By 2007, she met US Navy pilot Ron Youngblood, stationed in Buenos Aires. Reportedly, he had been a customer of Veronica’s, and soon, they turned this into a dating relationship. Two years later, they traveled to Las Vegas, where they got married.</p><p>Ron worked with the US Navy, which required him to travel worldwide. Veronica now had a stable life as Ron was taking care of her. Eventually, they had a daughter named Brooklynn Youngblood.</p><p>According to sources, Veronica cheated on her husband, and when the US Navy man found he became controlling, the relationship eventually broke. Ron wanted to take custody of her daughter, but Veronica was against it. Out of anger, she killed both her daughters on August 5.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Fred Daibes Wiki, Age, Wife, Kids, Net Worth, and More</a></p><h3><strong>Veronica Youngblood FAQ</strong></h3><p>Ques: How old is Veronica Youngblood?</p><p>Ans: 38.</p><p>Ques: When was Veronica Youngblood born?</p><p>Ans: In 1985.</p><p>Ques: Is Veronica Youngblood American?</p><p>Ans: She is from Argentina.</p><p>Ques: Who is Veronica Youngblood’s ex-wife?</p><p>Ans: Ron Youngblood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmr52ipLuqr8BmsKitnpyvrbvOnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
