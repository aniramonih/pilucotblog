They went on to welcome four children: son A.J. (Atiim Kiambu Jr.) in 2002, son Chason in 2004 and twin daughters Riley and Ella in 2010.</p><p>One month before their baby girls’ arrival, news broke in April 2010 that the NFL player and his then-wife were separating. It was later revealed that <a href=#>Barber had an affair</a> with Johnson, who was an NBC intern while he was working at the <a href=#>Today</a> show.</p><p>“I didn’t want to interact with people,” he told Sports Illustrated in May 2011 of the aftermath of the relationship drama. “I didn’t have passion for life. It may have been a form of depression.”</p><p>The Game Day author began his broadcasting career in 2007 after <a href=#>retiring from football</a>, but his NBC contract was not renewed in the wake of his cheating scandal.</p><p>“I had a bad marriage. I left. It doesn’t mean I’m a bad father. I fell in love with someone else,” Barber noted in his May 2011 interview. “You’re walking down a path, and you know it’s not right. Do whatever it takes to change. Sometimes it’s easy. Sometimes it’s violent. Mine was violent. But somehow it seems right. … In dealing with life — whether it’s divorce or pleasing the boss — sometimes it’s just not in your hands. You’re dealing with [the] emotions and realities of other people.”</p><p>In July 2012 — just over one week after his divorce from Cha was finalized — Barber and Johnson tied the knot in a civil ceremony in New York City. While marking their ninth wedding anniversary, Johnson reflected on how the couple chose to work through their highs and lows.</p><p>“9 years later and every dinner out with you still feels like a date. Here is to a marriage that is all about growth, learning, acceptance and unconditional love and loyalty,” she wrote via Instagram in July 2021. “There is no one better to be a life partner with than you. Thank you for 9 years of evolution, love, countless dinners at Cafe&nbsp;Lux and here is to a lifetime of more. #anniversary #marriage #love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month prior, reports surfaced that Johnson was eyeing a place on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> after she was spotted filming with several cast members including <a href=#><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong></a>. When the <a href=#>first trailer for season 12</a> dropped in December 2021, Johnson appeared as a “friend” of the Garden State reality stars.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the couple’s love story:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaq3yGaZmqqSmr9uwNGamqJlnK67r3nJqJ%2Bnq5%2BjwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
