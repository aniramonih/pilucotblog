All of them will be in New Orleans on April 6, 2018, for the prestigious ceremony.</p><p>As of right now, it seems that all of this year's inductees have been announced. There is every possibility that another former star could join them especially since Bam Bam Bigelow has been rumored to join the class of 2018. There is also normally one posthumous induction into the HOF every year and sadly Bigelow fits that description.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=#>SUPERSTARS REACT TO MARK HENRY'S HALL OF FAME INDUCTION</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Taylor-and-Bigelow.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Brad Shepard of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bodyslam.net</a>, the plans to induct Bigelow this year have now been changed. Shepard claims that a source told him Bigelow was actually never on the list of inductees that was put together back in December. However, apparently, names such as Mark Henry, Hillbilly Jim, and Jeff Jarrett were also not on that original list. The likelihood is that Bigelow will be inducted next year when WrestleMania returns to his native of New Jersey.</p><p>Those who wrestled and shared a locker room with Bam Bam Bigelow often cite him as one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time. Even though he headlined WrestleMania XI against <a href=#>Lawrence Taylor</a> Bigelow never held a title in WWE let alone a World Championship. He was a World Champion in ECW, however, where he had epic matches with the likes of Taz and Shane Douglas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are very few people in the business that would have any issue with Bam Bam Bigelow being inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame. Plus, if all the above is true, it doesn't sound like a case of the decision makers not wanting him to be in there, just that it will be more special this time next year when they can induct him in his hometown. This time next year, we fully expect Bigelow to have been announced as a part of the 2019 Hall Of Fame class.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8GapGaakaJ6o7XGnqOor12sxKZ5x5qjpWWWlrqmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
