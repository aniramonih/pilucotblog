His parents, Earl and June Swagger, are both Arkansas State Troopers. His father is a retired Marine first sergeant and Medal of Honor winner. In 1955, Bob Lee’s father passed away, but not before teaching his son respect for weapons and helping him develop his innate Swagger talent with them.</p><p>Swagger enlists in the Marines and becomes a renowned sniper for the force. Bob the Nailer, so named for his amazing skill with a rifle, served three tours in Vietnam with Special Operations. He has killed 391 soldiers in combat but has only been given credit for 87.</p><p>His most noteworthy fight came when a North Vietnamese Army battalion was closing in on a poorly fortified Special Forces base. Swagger and his spotter, Lance Corporal Donny Fenn, killed almost 80 enemy soldiers before Swagger’s ammunition ran out, delaying the battalion for two days until air backup could arrive.</p><p><strong>For more information on the shows’ characters, read the articles we’ve provided below:</strong></p><h2>Is Bob Lee a Real Person or Friction?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bob-Lee-Swagger-Character.webp><p>There is no such thing as Bob Lee Swagger.
