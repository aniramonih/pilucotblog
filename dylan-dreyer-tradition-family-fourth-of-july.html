Her son Ollie's birthday is just two days before Independence Day, which means that they've developed their own tradition to coincide with the usual celebrations.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eklygHM-Ozx data-wc=85>She shared a clip of Ollie sat at a marble table with a small square of cake on a plate in front of them, out of which burned a big red candle with a fizzing, sparkling flame. Ollie certainly looked contemplative as he looked at the bright flame, but he was accompanied by his brothers Cal and Rusty for the special moment. They only sang half the lyrics to "Happy Birthday" to commemorate it only being his half birthday, watching as the candle fizzled out.</p><p id=eAtTiOv4GLH data-wc=50>In one moment, it looked like Rusty, Dylan's youngest, would attempt to blow out the fierce candle - but sensibly, his older brother Ollie told him not to. Meanwhile, Rusty and Dylan seemed to comment on how "dangerous" the candle was as they waited for it to blow itself out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/474ecf903f47-snapinstaapp4349176373944404101809443142500259398260175n1080.jpg><p id=eZ6N64Ms6TF data-wc=50>Dylan captioned the video: "Two days before the 4th of July is Ollie’s half birthday…the time honored tradition of singing half the birthday song and finding out the cool candle I bought was apparently an indoor firework that probably should have been used outside! Happy 4 and a half Ollie!!"</p><p id=eODxaULORSX data-wc=23>Fans took to the comments to wish her middle son a happy half birthday, with some commenting on the over the top candle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2207f1a412f8-snapinstaapp4494190921134271924511926973477449679450849n1024.jpg><p id=e0EY2tzbvIo data-wc=34>"I love how Ollie was so protective of Rusty when he wanted to blow out that candle", one fan commented, while another added that it looked like Ollie was "afraid to blow it out."</p><p id=eg5js48Npy6 data-wc=29>Another commented on how fast the boys were all growing up, saying: "They’re so sweet! I still think of Rusty as a baby - love to hear his voice."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/188b8920690a-snapinstaapp4492334464933400932654776784307651458947521n1024.jpg><p id=eAJuA6H2VRh data-wc=63>Ollie's half birthday is certainly nicer news for Dylan to share with her fans after <a class=hm-link href=#>she admitted she had to take her youngest son to the ER</a>. She explained that Rusty required stitches after he bumped his head. According to the mom of three, it was the first time she'd had to go to the hospital because one of her kids needed stitches.</p><p id=eRA0_vKq6jd data-wc=22>"3 boys and this is our first set of stitches", she wrote. "Never would have bet on Rusty to be the first!"</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Dylan Dreyer returns to New York City with injury — concerned fans react" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f81e483fd3ba-gettyimages-1140512218-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Dylan Dreyer returns to New York City with injury — concerned fans react" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Dylan Dreyer returns to New York City with injury — concerned fans react</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Dylan Dreyer closes out 'special time' away from Today and home with chic red-hot look" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b3bf049072e5-today-dylan-dreyer-parenting-debate.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Dylan Dreyer closes out 'special time' away from Today and home with chic red-hot look" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Dylan Dreyer closes out 'special time' away from Today and home with chic red-hot look</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e679_lmTxKu data-wc=33>It was all in a day's work for a "boy mom", as she revealed that afterwards she made gluten free hamburger rolls after having to sop up Calvin's cut chin with her t-shirt.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
