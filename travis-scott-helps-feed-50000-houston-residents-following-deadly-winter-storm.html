It left the state's infrastructure in shambles, with many left without food, power, or water for weeks. Fortunately, a few philanthropic minded individuals have stepped in to help, among them <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>, whose <a href=#>Cactus Jack Foundation</a> reportedly partnered with Houston's Mayor Sylvester Turner to deliver some 50,000 hot meals to those in need as a result of the crisis.</p><p>Truckloads of meals from local restaurants as well as supplies of bottled water were made across Scott's native Houston, focusing specifically on the 30 highest-priority zip codes and serving the residents most in need within them.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-510138632.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316150 class=wp-caption-text>Paul Morigi/Getty Images</p><p>The emergency initiative was evidently organized rather quickly between Scott's foundation and various organizations within the city of Houston, so much so that there didn't appear to be too many press materials released in conjunction with the effort. But it represents only the latest of Scott's philanthropic efforts in his hometown, which have also included a massive toy drive over the recent holiday season, a scholarship program, and Cactus Jack Gardens, described on the foundation's official website as "a community garden initiative across elementary schools where students will learn agricultural economics and nutritional skills in an effort to combat food insecurity."</p><p>Scott launched the Cactus Jack Foundation in November of last year, with its focus intended to be education for young people, as per its website:</p><p><strong>"The Cactus Jack Foundation mission is to empower and enrich the lives of youth by providing access to education and creative resources to ensure long term success. The foundation believes the youth should not be prevented from attaining their lifetime goal and is committed to extending educational opportunities to all, regardless of their circumstances to achieve their dreams."</strong></p><p>Fortunately, the foundation is clearly flexible enough to reach to causes outside of education in case of emergency, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDA0ZqtoqtdqLCwwNNmn56koKh6p7HEnWRuaGBlfW60zq6qraeeYr%2Bmv8idnKeso2KzsLjLqK6ippdisaatw6WwZq%2BZo8Gmvoysq6iqnWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
