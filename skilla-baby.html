Detroit rapper Skilla recently went viral for expressing his disdain for the Los Angeles Lakers superstar in a video that was posted on social media.</p><p>In the video, Baby lists several reasons why he doesn’t like James, ranging from his jab-step jump shot and his star-studded teammates to his move from Cleveland to Miami and his 48-point performance against the Pistons in 2007. He also accuses James of traveling without getting called by the referees and being overrated by the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Skilla-Baby-bio.jpg><p>James, who is known for being active on social media and engaging with his fans and critics alike, responded to the video on his Instagram story. He reposted the clip and wrote, “Crazy thing is I HATE ME TOO,” along with several laughing emojis. He also added a crown emoji, indicating that he is still the king of the NBA.</p><p>James’ response showed that he has a sense of humor and can take criticism in stride. He also demonstrated his confidence and self-awareness, as he is not bothered by the opinions of others. James has faced plenty of scrutiny and backlash throughout his career, especially after his controversial decision to join the Miami Heat in 2010. He has also been compared to other NBA legends, such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and has been involved in several rivalries with other teams and players.</p><p>However, James has also proven his greatness on the court, winning four NBA championships, four MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, with over 38,000 points, and ranks fourth in career assists and eighth in career rebounds. He has also been selected to 19 All-Star games, the most in NBA history.</p><p>James is not only a basketball icon, but also a cultural icon, who has influenced various aspects of society, such as music, fashion, and social justice. He has collaborated with artists such as Drake, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar, and has launched his own media company, SpringHill Entertainment, which produces content for film, television, and digital platforms. He has also been vocal about issues such as racism, police brutality, and voting rights, and has supported various causes and charities, such as the LeBron James Family Foundation, which provides educational opportunities for underprivileged children.</p><p>Skilla, on the other hand, is a rising rapper and music artist from Detroit, who is best known for his singles “Mystical” and “Tiger Unit”. He is also a protégé of fellow Detroit rapper Sada Baby, who is a fan of James and has collaborated with him on several occasions. Skilla Baby has released several albums, such as “Crack Music”, “Carmelo Bryant”, and “Skilla Why You Ain’t Dropping Nothing”.</p><p>Baby’s rant about James may have been motivated by his loyalty to his hometown team, the Detroit Pistons, who have a long-standing rivalry with the Lakers. The Pistons and the Lakers have faced each other three times in the NBA Finals, with the Pistons winning twice, in 1989 and 2004. The Pistons are also one of the few teams that have a winning record against James in the playoffs, having eliminated him twice, in 2006 and 2007.</p><p>Skilla Baby is an American rapper and singer from Detroit, Michigan, who is best known for his songs “Trevon” and “Carmelo Bryant”. He is a rising star in the hip-hop industry and has a loyal fan base. He is also a philanthropist and a role model for many young people.
