Her mother, a dressmaker, was a devout Jehovah’s Witness follower with a strong love for make-up. While growing up, her mother trained her to see colour properly and the beauty of patterns. Despite all this, she describes her upbringing as religious and conservative.</p><p class=align-left>After school, Pat went to Northampton College, where she finished an art foundation course.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>How did pat McGrath start? In the 80's, Pat relocated to London, where she was involved with famous designers like John Galliano and Alexander McQueen. Her plans to pursue a fashion degree were abandoned after she met stylist Kim Bowen, who took her to the shooting of The Face and i-D. Later, she got her break when she was invited on a tour to Japan together with Caron Wheeler of Soul II Soul.</p><p class=align-left>After her trip to Japan, she met Edward Enninful, who was a director at i-D magazine in the fashion department. This encounter led her to be named the beauty director of i-D. To this day, Edward and Pat have worked together to bring forth magazine covers that have kept the world hooked. The pair even moved together to British Vogue where Edward became the first person of colour to lead the magazine. Edward proceeded to name her beauty Editor-At-Large in 2017.</p><p class=align-left>Aside from i-D, she has also worked for massive brands in the world that have dictated fashion and trends for decades now. For example, she has worked with none other than fashion maestro Giorgio Armani back in the day. Armani was blown away by her uniqueness and creativity. This would also explain why she has maintained such a good relationship with legendary cameraman Steven Meisel to produce stunning Vogue Italia covers year after year.</p><p class=align-left>In 2004, she was employed by Procter and Gamble as the Global Beauty Creative Design Director, where she oversaw things like Max Factor and Covergirl. She has also worked with brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Givenchy, and Miu Miu to name a few. Some of the top celebs she has worked with include Madonna, Cate Blanchett, Sarah Jessica Parker, Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna, and billionaire Kim Kardashian.</p><p class=align-left>In 2015, she started Pat McGrath Labs as her beauty line. By 2019, her company was valued at $1 billion and becoming Selfridges’ biggest selling beauty line.
