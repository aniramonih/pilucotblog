The couple tragically experienced a miscarriage in 2008 before welcoming their son Ludovic in 2009, and in 2014, their son Willem was stillborn.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoK7M_aP2Cp8 data-wc=63>Marina spoke out about the heartbreaking situation, writing in the about how she dealt with her children's questions afterwards. She wrote how her son – who was four at the time – complained of feeling sick soon after she came home from the hospital, and she soon realised that he was feeling anxious, rather than suffering from a sickness bug.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eHXPGc3KdP0v data-wc=76>She was advised to be honest with him, writing: "I proceeded to have a very difficult conversation with Ludo. We both cried, but he felt comfortable to ask the questions he needed. Almost miraculously, the knot of anxiety that had been plaguing him was untangled. The simple act of communication brought us closer and my honesty brought him comfort in the knowledge that, however hard it might be to bear, I would tell him the truth."</p><p id=eMZzPdM3PNUz data-wc=37>Marina has also spoken about her parenting approach to her children, including her attitude to their appearance. She admitted that she had stopped praising her nine-year-old daughter for her looks, instead wanting to focus on her personality.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=egdn_Jnmzasb data-wc=77>Marina noted: "Iona has become a beautiful person. Her hair has changed from black to blonde and her eyes are now a dazzling shade of blue. When she marches purposefully into a room, she lights it up. But is she pretty? I ask myself. The truth is that I don't really care. I'll praise her for what she's achieved – her generosity, how good a friend she is, her tenacity – rather than what nature has determined."</p><p id=eT7hmS3_ohp8 data-wc=19></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
