The five-year-old had pulled out all the stops, right down to placing paper fans on the beds for her guests! "My 5 yr old made a hotel with bunk beds, room service and glasses under your pillow. She made a fan and kept us cool," Tamzin shared. Comments quickly followed, with one user writing: "This is the cutest thing," while another said: "Ah kids have the best creative imaginations! So special." A third added: "Hope you have her a good Trip Advisor rating!!"</p><p id=et5_JtxhCL0m data-wc=60>Marnie is Tamzin's youngest daughter, who she shares with ex-husband Tom Ellis. The former couple are also parents to Florence, nine.

In an interview with TV Times, the soap star said: "What you bring to your performance is the wisdom and the experience.
