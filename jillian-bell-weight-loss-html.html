Inside Her Impressive Weight Loss J</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><a href=# rel=follow>Jillian Bell</a> has one of the most impressive weight loss journeys.&nbsp;During a jog around the block in the film Brittany Runs a&nbsp;Marathon, the title character stops herself near the front door and decides to change her life for the better. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During this moment of uncertainty, she obsessively frets with her thumbs over her fingers as she stands on the verge of a revelation.&nbsp;However, it isn't just a tic of the character, but rather of the person who plays her.</p><p>Jillian Bell explained she balled&nbsp;up her hands like Brittany's character when nervous about something. Doing so, she felt, gave a genuine and authentic dimension to the person on screen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>This little quirk is not the only bit of personality Bell has given to her role. She has gone, or should we say, ran the extra mile.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Weight Loss Motivation</h2><p>For the film's physical <a href=# rel="follow noopener">metamorphosis</a>, she claims no one requested her to undergo weight loss. Despite this, Bell thought she had done nothing like this before.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Brittany goes through the same thing, so the actress figured it would better help her understand the character. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Jillian Bell posing for a picture. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, a&nbsp;person familiar with Bell's previous work quickly points out that emotional realism is not one of her strong points. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As an office mate in Workaholics and an aggressive dorm-mate in 22 Jump Street, she's arguably most known for stealing the show with her comedy.</p><p>However, her unique timing and delivery have made her a regular presence in the genre.&nbsp;When Brittany Runs a&nbsp;Marathon came along, though, she searched for an opportunity to play something beyond her comfort zone.</p><p>With the initial screenplay, Bell's manager had included a preface. A few pages into the script, the actress was told that she might be a little perplexed about how it would turn out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But she urged her to keep continuing because the message was lovely and unique.&nbsp;Her curiosity had peaked.</p><p>As soon as she started reading, she was completely absorbed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Did Jillian Bell Lose Weight for 'Brittany Runs a Marathon?'</h2><p>Bell had never <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exercised</a> before, and she didn't like it. So she took up running, just like her character, and suffered mightily with it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But she persisted. About two months before filming began, she began meeting with a personal trainer at a gym and sobbed through almost every session.&nbsp;</p><p>It was then time for her to put on the running shoes and experience how it feels to force herself to get out of bed in the morning, prepare a meal, and exercise.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to Bell, people don't talk enough about the emotional hardship that comes with it.</p><p>Furthermore, she stated that there are plenty of moments in movies where a female character goes through weight loss, and then her life is fantastic as she is now a size four. She was fed up with this standard. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Brittany Runs a&nbsp;Marathon doesn't <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sugarcoat</a> the difficulties of changing one's life, be it physically, emotionally, or professionally. And Bell's portrayal is rendered more vivid by the experience she brings to the role, all 40lbs lighter.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jillian Bell, after her weight loss journey from&nbsp;Brittany Runs a Marathon. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It wasn't until the movie's end that the actress realized she did not know what to do with her life afterward. But, to her, it ended up being in a state of perfect equilibrium.</p><p>Bell commented that it's still fun for her to run. However, she does not keep up with her clean diet as much as she should.</p><p>She also confessed that initially, she would beat herself over for not being consistent with her workouts. That's when she realized the line between the movie and real-life blurred for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She then had to learn how to give herself a break. Bell now has a more nuanced view of method acting because&nbsp;of the impact&nbsp;Brittany Runs a&nbsp;Marathon has on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">outlook</a> on weight loss, health, and fitness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKZobmqrc1mmZ6knGLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
