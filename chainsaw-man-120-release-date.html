Since War Devil and Control Devil will be battling it out, it is difficult to foresee what will happen next. In the following chapter, Denji will learn about her, and Nayuta may come to understand Asa’s true identity.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Denji will make an effort to explain the situation to Nayuta, but I believe it is too late because Yoru has already been impaled by Nayuta’s chain.
