We don’t want to get our regular tees and tanks so sweaty and stretched out that we can’t even wear them out anymore. Plus, a plain tee does the absolute minimum in the motivation department. We put it on and all we want to do is sleep.</p><p>Having tops specifically for working out is so much more important that it may seem. Just seeing one hanging in our closet can be a deciding factor on whether or not we’re going to head to the gym that day. Maybe it even has a message that motivates us that much more! We picked out five tops from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">simplyWORKOUT</a> that will not only keep our regular tops safe, but inspire us to actually hit up that yoga, barre, HIIT or Crossfit class we’re considering!</p><p><strong>Glow Getter Navy Muscle Tank</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glow-Getter.jpg><p>Skincare and makeup are great go-tos for glowing skin, but a good workout might just be the best ingredient to leave us completely radiant! This top reminds us that if we want to be a Glow Getter, which we do, we need to put the effort in, and we’ll feel so great once we do. This top has deep arm holes which not only look cute, but keep us cool while we’re sweating it out on the treadmill or yoga mat!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glow Getter Navy Muscle Tank</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$36</a> at simplyWORKOUT!</strong></p><p><strong>Lucky Honey Stick with Pilates – Crop Tee</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pilates.jpg><p>We have such a love/hate relationship with pilates. We love the way a class makes us feel and how it keeps us toned, but when we’re halfway through a set of the Pilates 100s, we sometimes just want to lie back and give up. This adorable crop tee inspires us to stick with it! Plus, in a top like this and a pair of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> adorable, grippy ToeSox</a>, we’re going to want to give it our all again and again!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky Honey Stick with Pilates – Crop Tee</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$23</a> at simplyWORKOUT!</strong></p><p><strong>Emi Jay Empower Cropped Tank – Black</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Empower-Tank.jpg><p>What better way to drive a point home than with repetition? We do multiple reps of each move in our workout, after all. This tank top has the word “empower” stacked up to not only empower us, but help us to empower others. This top is one size fits all, featuring dropped arm holes, and we’d wear it both in and out of the gym!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emi Jay Empower Cropped Tank – Black</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$44</a> at simplyWORKOUT!</strong></p><p><strong>Movement Heals Muscle Tank</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Movement-Heals-Tank.jpg><p>“Movement heals.” It’s that simple. Whether we’re running, dancing, crunching or suffering through seemingly endless burpees, we’re going to come out on the other side feeling rejuvenated. This tank reminds of us that with a cute blue and yellow graphic. This tank has a high-low hem and side slits, never forgetting that we love to sweat in style!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movement Heals Muscle Tank</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$24</a> at simplyWORKOUT!</strong></p><p><strong>Joah Brown Exhale Tank</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Exhale.jpg><p>This top may not feature a graphic, but turn it around to find an accent that’s just as effective. Criss-cross straps drape across our back in this flowy, breezy tank. We want to show off our cute sports bras, and this tank gives us the perfect opportunity to do just that! It’s still available in two colors, so let’s make sure to grab our favorite! Just imagine how many compliments we’re going to get!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joah Brown Exhale Tank</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$53</a> at simplyWORKOUT!</strong></p><p><strong>Looking for something else?
