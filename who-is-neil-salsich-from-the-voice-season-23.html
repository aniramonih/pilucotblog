He subsequently attended Louis University High School. Neil Salsich has two younger sisters, Lizzie and Maya.&nbsp;Salsich learned to use his father’s radio when he was six years old because he wanted to listen to Ramblin’ Man on repeat.

They will also have the ability to “save” one of their performers from elimination. The challenge victor will receive a $100,000 monetary reward as well as an audio CD.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Neil-Salsich-2.jpg alt="Neil Salsich" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The following is NBC’s summary of The Voice:</p><p>“Contestants are chosen through public tryouts and taught by a group of four trainers who lead and evaluate their performances in search of America’s next great talent.”</p><p>Every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET, NBC will broadcast new segments of The Voice.
