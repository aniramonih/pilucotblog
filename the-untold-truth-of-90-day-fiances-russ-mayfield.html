Unfortunately, he lost his job during the second season of <a href=#>90 Day Fianc√©:&nbsp;Happily Ever After</a>. While he struggled to find work, Paola Mayfield accepted modeling jobs to provide for their household.</p><p>Although they were both grateful for the income, he wasn't completely on board with his wife modeling swimsuits and lingerie. Modeling drove a further wedge in their relationship when Paola decided to move to Miami, Fla. by herself because there were more opportunities there than in Oklahoma.</p><p>Eventually, Russ compromised and moved to Miami, too. According to his <a href=#>LinkedIn</a> profile, Russ worked as a Field Engineer at Pure Technologies in Miami from January 2017 to September 2018. After that, he began working as a Technical Product Lead at the same company. Plus, he and Paola have been a part of every Happily Ever After season, which is a paid gig.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hhbYV3e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5mGlknZmpYrOqrc2cnKxloqrAtHnMmrCfoZWhsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
