Recently, Netflix released the <a href=#>Attorney Woo Young Woo </a>series, a show that got praised for how perfectly it represented the autistic community. Coming to Netflix is another Drama series labeled Somebody. Directed by Jung Ji Woo and written by Han Ji Wan, the upcoming <a href=#>psychological thriller</a> is based on the famous American Thriller named American Psycho. With the first season scheduled to be released soon, there are questions about when the show’s second season will debut. Here is everything we know about the upcoming series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Somebody Season 2 Release Date: When will it appear?</h2><p>The release date of the second season remains unknown. The second season will not be coming out anytime soon, as the first season is yet to be released. The first season debuts on November 18th, and until the series is renewed, we do not know if it will be coming for the second season. If Somebody gets a renewal, you should expect the series trailer to be out by 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Somebody Season 2 Plot: What will happen?</h2><p>The series plot revolves around three individuals; Som, Ki Eun, and Mok Won. Som, one of the series leads, is a developer with a mobile app famously known as Somebody. Soon enough, her mobile app is tied to a murder that has just happened, and she is forced to come in for questioning. However, she is lucky as the investigator is her friend Ki Eun, but this does not make the case any easier, considering it is a criminal case. We have yet to determine the second season plot; however, it will be determined by what the first season will include.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Somebody Season 2 Cast: Who will be in?</h2><p>Kim Young Kwang is famous for starring in the Netflix series Hello, Me! Stars as Sung Yun OH. He is joined by other casts, including Kang Hae Lim, who stars as some, and will be among the series leads. This is the second time the actress will come to our screens after featuring in the Avengers series. Kim Yong Ji (<a href=#>Alchemy of Souls</a>), featured in many Netflix series, including The King, Eternal Monarch, and Mr. Sunshine, will star as Mok Won. Finally, Kim Soo-Yeon, who has never appeared in any series, will star as Gi Eun. If the Somebody series gets a renewal for the second season, then you should expect all of them to reprise their roles. The series could also feature new faces in the next season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Somebody Season 2 Trailer: When Should We Expect?</h2><p>The trailer for the Somebody series season 2 is yet to be released, and we are afraid it will not be coming out anytime soon. The first season is yet to be released, and we will have to wait for Somebody season one to be green-lighted before we are sure of the second season. In the meantime, you can check out the first season trailer, which was already released and is available on both Netflix and Youtube. It would be best if you also marked your calendars for November 18th, when the series’ first season will be debuting. If the series gets a green light for the second season, expect it to be out by 2024.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK570qiknpqfmcZuv8SaqqimXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm6vwKyrZqicpMFuwc%2BdmK2do2LBs63IpZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
