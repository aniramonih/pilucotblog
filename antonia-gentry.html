Toni entered the acting industry in 2014, playing the role of a Teenage Driver in “PSA Don’t Text and Drive Pay Attention.” Just a year after its debut, Gentry starred as Sara in the film named “Driver’s Ed: Tales from the Street.”</p><p>In 2021, Antonia gathered accolades for her performance in “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ginny & Georgia</a>.” Here she played the role of a 15-year-old girl named Ginny Miller, who often feels that she is more mature than her 30-year-old mother, Georgia Miller (Brianne Howey). The audience loved the show’s storyline, which motivated makers to come up with the second installment, which aired on January 5, 2023.</p><p>According to Toni’s&nbsp;IMDB profile, she is working with Hannah Macpherson on a horror movie titled “Time Cut.” The release date of Gentry’s upcoming film has yet to be out, but there are speculations that we will soon get to watch it on Netflix.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Actress Antonia Gentry With Boyfriend Ezra Pounds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Netflix-Ginny-Georgia-Actress-Antonia-Gentry-With-Boyfriend-Ezra-Pounds.jpg alt="Netflix Ginny & Georgia Actress Antonia Gentry With Boyfriend Ezra Pounds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Who is Antonia Gentry’s Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>In January 2021, Antonia shared a photo with her boyfriend, Ezra Pounds, on her Instagram account (_antoniagentry_) and became a topic of talk. Sources revealed that they both are high school sweethearts. But shockingly, those photographers aren’t on IG anymore as the actress deleted them.</p><p>The removal of the boyfriend’s photographs from social media handles creates a lot of doubts in the mind because usually, people/celebrities remove photos of their better half when they break ties with them. But we are yet to confirm whether this is the case between Toni and Ezra.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Antonia Gentry with mother Sandra Gentry and father" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Antonia-Gentry-with-mother-Sandra-Gentry-and-father.jpg alt="Antonia Gentry with mother Sandra Gentry and father" width=400 height=415 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>How Old is Antonia Gentry?</strong></h3><p>On&nbsp;September 25, 1997, Antonia Bonea Gentry (age 25)&nbsp;was born in Atlanta, Georgia, America.
