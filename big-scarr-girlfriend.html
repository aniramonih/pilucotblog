He may have died unmarried or with an unknown significant other – nobody knows for sure.</p><p>Despite his fame and popularity, Scarr seems intent on keeping his romantic relationships private. After becoming successful in Hollywood, he has never openly discussed any of the women he has been romantically involved with, refusing to grant any interviews about those subjects.&nbsp;</p><p>His close friends state that he doesn’t discuss his personal life with anyone. We can only speculate about whether or not Scarr ever had a serious relationship, but it appears that he intentionally shuns the spotlight when it comes to matters of the heart.&nbsp;</p><p>With this privacy measure in place, it’s unlikely that we’ll ever learn anything about who has stolen the famous actor’s heart – at least for now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Big Scarr</h2><p>Big Scarr was a rapper from the United States and an artist on Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records.
