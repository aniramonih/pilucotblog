It is known worldwide as the Giant of Africa, a title it earned due to its population and fast-growing economy. With a total population of over two hundred and six million, one hundred and forty thousand (206,140,000) people, it is the most populated African country—almost twice the population of Ethiopia, the second-largest country in Africa. It has also been predicted that by 2050, Nigeria will become the third most populated country in the world, and many of these people will be eking out a living in the largest cities in Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>Nigeria is a Large Country with Many Cities and Regions</strong></h2><p>Because of its large population and landmass, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nigeria</a> consists of cities with equally large landmass and population density. The country has 36 states divided into six geopolitical zones (northeast, north-west, south-east, south-west, south-south, and north-central). These various regions comprise different cities with varied features, including tribes, languages, population, landmass, and infrastructure.</p><p>The northwest region is the most populated area of the country and equally has the largest landmass. Although infrastructural development is spread across the country, it is not evenly distributed. The city with the highest level of infrastructure and economic activities is in the southwestern part of the country. Also, the languages and tribes vary greatly from one region to another and even within regions.</p><h2><strong>Ten Largest Cities in Nigeria by Population and Infrastructural Development</strong></h2><p>Among the 36 states in Nigeria, some are more densely populated and have better infrastructural development than others. Below is a list of the top 10 most populated cities that have massive infrastructures.</p><h3><strong>1. Lagos</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nigeria-Lagos-Victoria-Island-Urbanization.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Lagos</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 21 million</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 2,607km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: South-west</li><li>Others: Yoruba is the dominant ethnic group</li></ul><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lagos</a> is arguably the largest city in Nigeria. With about twenty-one million (21,000,000) people, it is recorded as the most populated city in West Africa. Oftentimes, when people abroad talk about Nigeria, they refer to Lagos because it is the hub for almost all economic activities. Despite the high standard of living, many people still migrate to Lagos because of the ample opportunities available there. Being the center of economic activities in the country, it houses major industries and headquarters.</p><p>The state is home to the renowned Nollywood industry. Also, most companies like Dangote Cement, BUA, cement, and even foreign companies like Jumia and MTN are found there. The well-known Murtala Muhammed International Airport is also located here. In total, the state houses about thirty-three thousand, four hundred and fifty-eight (30,458) companies.<br>Irrespective of its large economic activities, about 66% of the population lives in the slum. This is due to the high cost of living and huge social margin in the area. However, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lagos</a> has a good number of employment opportunities. This city is equally known for its unending traffic congestion obviously caused by the large population.</p><h3><strong>2. Kano</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kano.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Kano</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 16 million</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 442km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: North-West</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic groups are Hausa and Fulani</li></ul><p>This is the second most populated city in the country, and it is mainly occupied by Hausa and Fulani tribes. With a population of sixteen million (16,000,000) people, Kano State is the major commercial state of the North. It has active industries in agriculture, food processing, and textile. Most of the industries are centered on industrial estates. Some significant structures present in Kano are the newly constructed Kanawa International market, an international airport, and several educational institutions. The state has about one thousand, two hundred and forty-seven (1,247) companies.</p><p>The cost of living in Kano State is low, unlike Lagos. However, the current security challenges facing the northern part of the country have resulted in fewer employment opportunities and reduced migration into this area.</p><h3><strong>3. Ibadan</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-city_panorama_ibadan.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Oyo</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 6 million</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 831 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical</strong> <strong>Zone</strong>: South-West</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic group is the Yoruba</li></ul><p>Ibadan is the capital of Oyo State, one of the most popular states in the Western part of Nigeria. The city has a population of about six million (6,000,000) people, and its available infrastructure and employment opportunities have continued to attract more people to the city. Known for its commercial and trade activities, Ibadan houses about one thousand, five hundred and fifty-three (1,553) companies. It is also the home to Nigeria’s first university, the University of Ibadan (UI), and a domestic airport.</p><p>The city has a fair standard of living with very affordable accommodation. However, the increasing population has put the infrastructures under high pressure, which has resulted in some adverse environmental effects, including poor sanitation, increased slump dwellings, and open drainage.</p><h3><strong>4. Abuja</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2610ee5355d247cff1aa929c046bee0b.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Abuja</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 3,464,123</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 439 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: North Central</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic group is Hausa</li></ul><p>The capital of Nigeria, Abuja, is the fastest growing city in Africa and one of the fastest in the world.

The popular Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport is located here among several other infrastructures. The city has about eighteen thousand, three hundred and fifty-one (18,351) companies and has high employment opportunities.</p><p>With an estimated population of three million, four hundred and sixty-four thousand, one hundred and twenty-three (3,464,123), the city still experiences an influx of people. The increased influx of people into Abuja is no doubt in search of greener pastures. The cost of living in the city is very high, but the surrounding rural areas have a cheaper cost of living.</p><h3><strong>5. Port Harcourt</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Port-Harcourt-City.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Rivers</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 3,179,402</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 2726 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: South-South</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic groups are Ijaw, Ikwerre, and Ogoni</li></ul><p>This prominent city has a population of about three million, one hundred and seventy-nine thousand, four hundred and two (3,179,402) people. Founded in 1912 by Fredrick Lugard, the city is mainly known for possessing crude oil. The oil was discovered in 1956, and it led to the building of several companies and the creation of employment opportunities. Port Harcourt has continued to grow as more people migrate there searching for jobs in different oil companies.</p><p>The city houses seven thousand, six hundred and fourteen (7,614) companies, including Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, etc. It also has a Port Harcourt International Airport located on the outskirts of the city. Most of its higher institutions are government-owned, and it is equally known to have a high standard of living.</p><h3><strong>6. Benin City</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/maxresdefault-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Edo</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 1,781,999</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 953 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zon</strong>e: South-South</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic group is Fon</li></ul><p>The city of Benin is known for its rich culture and history. What was formerly known as the Benin Kingdom is the capital city of Edo state, but they are one of the few Nigerian cities that managed to retain their culture post-colonization. The city has continued to grow and has a current estimated population of one million, seven hundred and eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine (1,781,999) people.</p><p>The major reason many people visit this city is because of its tourist attraction sites. Places like the Palace of the Oba of Benin, the National Museum, and the King’s square have been a huge attraction to Nigerians and foreigners. Having about eight hundred and seventy-nine (879) companies, the city provides employment opportunities but not as many other populated places.</p><p>The city is best known for its artworks, including bronze, casting, and metalwork, which are mostly related to their culture. It also has a domestic airport that serves transportation within the country.</p><h3><strong>7. Aba</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Aba.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Abia</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 1,114,388</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 7400 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: South-East</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic group is Igbo</li></ul><p>This commercial hub of the east is located in Abia State and is known for the production of several goods.

The city has about one hundred and forty-four companies and not as much infrastructure as other large cities. It is known for trading and has a low standard of living. One of its known infrastructures is the Maiduguri International Airport. The city does not experience much migration of people due to the current security challenges in the northern part of Nigeria.</p><h3><strong>9. Zaria</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zaria.jpg><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Kaduna</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 736,098</li><li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 1234.6 km-2</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: North-West</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Dominating ethnic groups are Hausa and Fulani</li></ul><p>Zaria was formerly called Zazzau, and it is one of the seven old “Hausa City-State.” It was renamed after the popular queen Amina Zaria.

However, when it comes to cities, one will notice that the cities with the largest landmass are not restricted to the northern region.

Gusau</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gusau.10.gif><ul><li><strong>State</strong>: Zamfara</li><li><strong>Land Mass</strong>: 3364 km/sq</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 528,400</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: North-West</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: located on Sokoto river</li></ul><p>The capital of Zamfara State, Gusau, has an estimated population of five hundred and twenty-eight thousand, four hundred (528,400) people.

The 1769 km/sq. the area also has a favorable climate compared to other northern cities.</p><p>As one of the largest cities in Nigeria, it is worthy to note that the high cost of living within Abuja city center has made some of the people who earn a living by working in Abuja rent or even build homes in a neighboring state like Nasarawa (Nyanya axis). This has on its own made such new settlements a beehive of commercial activities, which has brought development to such places.</p><h3><strong>6. Kuje</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/abuja-map.jpg><ul><li><strong>Location</strong>: Abuja</li><li><strong>Land Mass</strong>:1644 km/sq</li><li><strong>Population</strong>: 246,400</li><li><strong>Geopolitical Zone</strong>: North Central</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Covered with a lot of greenery</li></ul><p>Like is a suburb of the capital territory.
