From a new photo that was recently shared by the daughter of Kimora, Aoki, it was confirmed that the family could not be happier, especially after they recently welcomed the newest addition to their circle, an adopted 10-year-old boy, named Gary.</p><p>In the latest snap, Aoki could be seen smiling as she is surrounded by her mother and all of her siblings.</p><p>The 17-year-old soon-to-be Harvard student jokingly described the photo with a joke, as in the caption, she wrote “Mama shark and her baby sharks” in a possible reference to the popular hit “Baby Shark” by Pink Fong.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5b_yZWnv8N/</p><p>The picture was quickly met with praise from many fans, and the presence of Gary is quite noticeable, as Kimora has four other children, Ming, Aoki, Kenzo, and Wolfe.</p><p>Adopting a child is definitely not a decision to be taken lightly, and a lot of Kimora’s fans congratulated her on her bravery, as many people wrote positive comments to the fashion mogul, pointing out that she deserved all the support she could get for what she was doing.</p><p>A few shamed her by saying this: “And three baby daddies 🤭.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7UmiOMno4W/</p><p>One defender said: “You have your opinion I have mine 🤷‍♀️ it doesn’t affect me I’m not really on here digging for attention just voicing how I feel dude its👉 social media👈 it is not that deep 🤣🤷‍♀️ Idk what your motives are, but that’s where we differ I stand on what I stated regardless upgrade your mindset or not 🤣🤷‍♀️whatever 💅”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Er4XhhBOs/</p><p>A backer shared: “Correction; 3 husbands. That’s what married people do; procreate. Husbands are different from baby daddies. They just mad! Your Mom and the whole family are Beautiful. ❤️”</p><p>Aoki defended her mother by blasting the critic: “Three long term partners over the years and you are sitting here with no profile picture and can’t get ONE. Bye 👋🏽.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B62BgaFHGl5/</p><p>This person added: “Why can’t she just adopt and not be asked such a rude question..she has the income to be a blessing to another child why not.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6fVTd_nkPd/</p><p>However, it is the businesswoman’s daughters that have gathered more attention throughout the years, mainly because they are Kimora’s eldest children and have actively collaborated with their mother in the development of her fashion line, “Baby Phat.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The fashion project took off back at the beginning of the century, and Ming and Aoki both served as the main models for promoting the brand, which eventually turned out to be quite successful for its time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebnrqwvsBmo56dXai2rrvNrGSrnZOatrex0malmqukrnqqutKuo62rXZaztbHRZpuemqWptq%2BzjKGcq2WemsRuv86nZKKmXajEprHTZqehp6SkwG60xKtknZmlnLW1sdFmmKijmWKwsLnErGSoraRiwLi1zaCgp59drLa1tIyapWadoJ6wbq%2FLmqdmmpGYuG5%2FlWpucnFf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
