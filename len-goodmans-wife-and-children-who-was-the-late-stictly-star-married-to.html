Fellow legends like Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas, Bruno Tonioli and more <a class=hm-link href=#>have also shared their heartbreak</a>.

The pair have been together for over 20 years and in 2012 tied the knot to become husband and wife.</p><p id=eJihCoTvQAf data-wc=77>The BBC star previously opened up about their decision to get married ten years into their relationship. He told the Daily Mail: "I knew I'd found the woman I wanted to be with for the rest of my life so why not get married? I've said before I'm selfish and that doesn't equate well for marriage, but My Wonderful Sue got that out of me. I've become totally unselfish, and I think that's because it's true love."</p><p id=e09fAr2gxsR data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Len Goodman's cause of death revealed - what is bone cancer?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e9JdAN9GcJ- data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Janette Manrara shares cryptic post as Strictly pro line-up confirmed</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9764871a7271-gettyimages-1170578971.jpg><p id=ery-rr4xWbI data-wc=24>Len and Sue, who was also a dance teacher, lived at their home in Kent near where they ran their own ballroom dance school.</p><p id=erDN-o6BzA2 data-wc=35>Prior to his relationship and subsequent marriage with Sue, Len was previously married to Cherry Kingston. Also a dancer, Cherry married Len in 1972 but the union was not to last and they later divorced.</p><h2>Did Len Goodman have children?</h2><p id=eQL3E9rBDpJ data-wc=46>Yes, Len Goodman welcomed one son with his former partner, Lesley. Although Len and Lesley did not marry, they welcomed James Goodman in January 1981. However, the couple split and when James was 12 he went to live with his mother on the Isle of Wight.</p><p id=eTQSKnGYolC data-wc=39>Len's son James tends to keep away from the spotlight but it seems he picked up his talent for dancing from his father and, in 2012, James reportedly began taking lessons at his dad's dance school, Goodman Dance Centre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a0bf3005bd4-bruno-len-darcey-and-craig-on-strictly.jpg><h2>Who is in Len Goodman's extended family?</h2><p id=eSC-sfDH-Y0 data-wc=39>Not only was Len a proud father, but he was also a proud grandfather.

"With grandchildren, you have all the joy without the responsibility, because you can just hand them back."</p><p id=ePOHtOnkNGP data-wc=56>Len's grandchildren were also a large factor in his <a class=hm-link href=#>decision to quit Dancing With the Stars</a>. The US-based competition meant Len had to travel extensively between home and the States and, in November 2022, he explained he wanted to remain in the UK to spend more time with his family.&nbsp;</p><p id=eG-QczMfJv data-wc=26></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGlxZWt8rbHNZp6op5Sirq%2B%2FjLCgn51dlrulecKhoKWcopq7bsPHqGSwmaNiwamxjKWYrZ1dqMGqr9OlsGarpJa%2FbrnAq6minZRiwbB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
