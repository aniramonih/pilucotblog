Her other top studio albums include&nbsp;</span><span>Glass Heart</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas with Love</span><span>&nbsp;(2013) and&nbsp;</span><span>I Am</span><span>&nbsp;(2015).&nbsp;Leona Lewis has worked with various top acts throughout her singing career including Ryan Tedder, Naughty Boy, Calum Scott, Max Martin, Avicii and Justin Timberlake.</span></p><p><span>She had the opportunity to sing with Led Zeppelin at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics.&nbsp;In addition, she signed a book deal in 2009 titled&nbsp;</span><span>Dreams</span><span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, during the book signing ceremony, she was attacked by a man who was eliminated at the X Factor and left her with bruises.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, she had her first film appearance in Running in&nbsp;</span><span>the Sunshine</span><span>&nbsp;, a romantic comedy in which she took on the role of Elena.&nbsp;She then starred in the Broadway theater production of&nbsp;</span><span>Cat</span><span>&nbsp;in 2016 as Grizabella.</span></p><p><span>She has a strong voice in advocating for animal welfare and animal welfare.&nbsp;Moreso, she has over time shown support for the Little Kids Rock Foundation, a music education NGO in the&nbsp;</span><span>USA.</span></p><p><span>Her contribution to the entertainment industry hasn’t gone unnoticed as she’s been nominated for 60 awards, 33 of which have included MOBO, MTV Video and World Music Awards to name a few.</span></p><p><span>Her current net worth is estimated at $30 million, which she has amassed from her record sales, touring, a perfume line and her autobiographical book, among other things.</span></p><h2><strong><span>parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>This talented diva was born to an African-Guyanese father, Aural Josiah Lewis, and her mother, Maria Lewis, are of Welsh origins but have Irish and Italian ancestry.&nbsp;Both parents were together for 20 years before tying the knot and they have been very supportive of their daughter’s musical career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>who is her husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Regarding Leona Lewis’s love life, she isn’t married yet, but she is engaged to her longtime partner Dennis Jauch.&nbsp;She previously had a 10-year love affair with Lou Al Chamaa, a former Sony Music employee.&nbsp;Both co-founded a clothing line that eventually wrapped up in 2012.&nbsp;They dated from 2000 to 2010 before going their separate ways.</span></p><p><span>She later met Dennis Jauch on one of her tours about 8 years ago, who became one of her backup dancers.&nbsp;Dennis Jauch is a choreographer and the two have been together since 2010, according to&nbsp;</span><span>Homeless</span><span>&nbsp;Crooner in November 2018, however the couple have not yet walked down the aisle at the time of this writing.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What happened to her?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The pop diva was rumored to have lost her voice and couldn’t hold her falsetto after her nose reconstruction surgery in 2011, but that’s far from the truth.&nbsp;The fact is that from 2007 to 2013 Leona Lewis overhauled her voice during the three major tours and concerts while performing 17 high-pitched songs (which she has compared to Celine Dion, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey) in a row for 64 nights without a break, one deed that affected her voice.&nbsp;However, this never ended her career, nor had anything to do with her disappearance from the scene.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, Leona Lewis was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease (an autoimmune disease that produces abnormal antibodies that damage the thyroid gland).&nbsp;She was very ill that she had lost some body mass and was even bedridden.&nbsp;So she took some time off to fully recover from her illness.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiklaS7onnLnq6iq12WtKZ5x66qm5memXqxrdGepa2rXZrBqbrInKCtsV2staLAjKGYqaiVo7KledOoZKGdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
