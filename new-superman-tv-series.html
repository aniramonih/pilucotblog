The big news this year is a massive crossover event called Crisis on Infinite Earths, which brings together heroes from those shows and many from the past as well. It will also mark the return of&nbsp;Supergirl&nbsp;guest stars <strong>Tyler Hoechlin</strong> and <strong>Bitsie Tulloch</strong> as Superman and Lois Lane, who, it’s been announced, are going to be starring in their own series for the network, Superman & Lois.</p><p>The rumors of a new series focusing on the Man of Steel began last October. The last time&nbsp;that the character was featured in a live-action TV show of his own was on the CW prequel <a href=#>Smallville</a>, which enjoyed a 10-year run beginning in 2001. Since then he’s primarily been on the big screen in the form of <strong><a href=#>Henry Cavill</a></strong> starting with 2013’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Man of Steel</a>; and then&nbsp;through a trio of guest appearances on the CW’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Supergirl</a>, with Tyler donning the famous blue and red costume.</p><p>The first show focusing on the character was 1952-1958’s Adventures of Superman, starring <strong>George Reeves</strong> as the Man of Steel. This was followed by 1966-1969’s animated The New Adventures of Superman, 1973-1985’s animated variations of Super Friends, 1988’s animated Superman as well as 1988-1992’s live-action Superboy&nbsp;(first played by <strong>John Haymes Newton</strong> and then <strong>Gerard Christopher</strong>), 1993-1997’s live-action <a href=#>Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</a>&nbsp;(with <strong><a href=#>Dean Cain</a></strong> donning the tights alongside <strong>Teri Hatcher</strong>),1996-2000’s Superman: The Animated Series, Smallville&nbsp;(starring <strong>Tom Welling</strong>), 2001-2006’s animated Justice League/Justice League Unlimited, the animated&nbsp;Justice League Action, which launched in 2016; and the recent series that indirectly involved the character, Krypton.&nbsp;Currently the character of Superboy is featured on the DC Universe streaming series&nbsp;Titans.</p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/supermen.jpg alt=supermen width=400 height=177 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 600px) 600px, 830px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Which leads us back to the new Superman & Lois, which has preceded by a number of events taking place involving the Man of Steel character that had been suggesting that this was a possibility.</p><p><strong>Please scroll down to check them out.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46nnLBlo6q9pr7MmqVmrKZiwKa%2ByJ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
