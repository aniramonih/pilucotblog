She appeared on TV as a child on several occasions thanks to her mother’s work and openness when it comes to her family, and now she’s set on pursuing an acting career.</p><p class=Zg>Although she took part in several interviews as a kid, Cassidy’s debut as an actress was in the 2004 TV film “Like Cats and Dogs,” and the following year she appeared on her first series on an episode of Disney’s “That’s So Raven.”</p><p class=Zg>She also appeared on “The Suite Life on Deck,” “Adventures of Serial Buddies,” “Blue Bloods,” and the controversial film “God's Not Dead.”</p><p class=Zg>Talking to Teen Vogue about what made her discover her passion for acting, Cassidy <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/last-look-cassidy-gifford>explained</a>:</p><p class=Zg>“Being on ‘That’s So Raven’ when I was twelve was what made me realize, ‘Wow, I love acting.’ Every day on set I’d pinch myself. My mom said going into it, ‘Cass, it’s a lot of work; you’re going to realize if you love it or hate it.’”</p><p class=Zg>“It’s true—it’s not as glamorous as everyone thinks it is,” she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/last-look-cassidy-gifford>continued</a>. “If it’s something you love, though, it’s incredible.”</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>The importance of carving her own path</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>For Cassidy, being her mom look-alike has been both a blessing and a curse.</p><p class=Zg>Although fans love her and she entered Esquire’s magazine list of “18 Beautiful Women America Won't Be Able to Resist This Summer” in 2018, she also wants to make sure to walk her path in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=Zg>As she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/SNktdtLiYtg>told</a> Entertainment Tonight:</p><p class=Zg>“It’s important for me to have my career completely compartmentalized and separated from my mom’s and it’s hard because 90% of the time there’s a preconceived notion about me going into any room for an audition or anything.”</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Cassidy Gifford, Cody Gifford, and Kathie Lee Gifford attend the 2018 Hallmark Channel Summer TCA at a private residence on July 26, 2018 | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=Zg>However, she recognizes that her mother is just being like any other mom wanting to get involved in their children’s lives, and since she’s already a renowned name, being part of the experience makes it better for her.</p><p class=Zg>Cassidy’s motivation to becoming an actress is not fame, and all the fanfare comes with it.</p><p class=Zg>“If I become famous as a result of [acting], that would be awesome, and I would be very blessed,” she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/o7DlBqUAdEw>said</a>. “But I just want to act.”</p><p class=Zg>Cassidy dreams of winning an Oscar someday. “I know is a big dream to live up to, but I’m hoping!" she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/last-look-cassidy-gifford>joked</a>.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Big dreams, more work</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Her most prominent<a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/cassidy-gifford-learned-ropes-acting-gallows-article-1.2278327> role so far</a> was in the thriller movie “The Gallows” in 2015.

The two of them have a healthy, loving bond, and enjoys spending family time together, alongside <a class="zd d" href=#>Cassidy’s brother, Cody.</a></p><p class=Zg>And although Kathie Lee is, indeed, a proud mother, she never uses that word when praising her children's achievements, as she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/kathie-lee-gifford-wont-tell-kids-shes-proud/>explained to People</a> that "Pride comes before the fall.
