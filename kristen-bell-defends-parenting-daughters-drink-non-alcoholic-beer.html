When they have tried to order [non-alcoholic beers] at a restaurant or something, it's because of a very specific connection to you.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's daughter has inherited her mum's singing talents</figure><p id=ea9XlnTH5xO data-wc=30>"Because first of all, they're educated on addiction and what substances are and how they affect your body and how scary they are and what they can do to you."&nbsp;</p><p id=eI1nKi0i--e data-wc=40>Derek added: "If anyone has a problem that I let my kids drink NA beer sometimes, that's fine with me.

And I'm like, maybe we just keep that for home time. But then I'm sort of like, you can judge me if you want, I'm not doing anything wrong. That's your problem."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d651610edf2-kristen-bell-dax-shepard-relationship-timeline-close-bond-z.jpg><p id=eQPlZaGGpMuI data-wc=81>Kristen's husband Dax is a recovering addict, and she also spoke about how he would occasionally drink non-alcoholic beer while caring for their daughter, Lincoln. "He likes non-alcoholic beer, so he'd pop one open, he'd have [Lincoln] on his chest, and we'd walk and look at the sunset," she explained. "As a baby, she was pawing at it, and sometimes she'd suck on the rim of it. So I think it feels to her like something special, something daddy, something family."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kristen Bell wows in plunging bridesmaid dress – see wedding photos" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/eeea1893dcb3-kristen-bell-bridesmaid-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kristen Bell wows in plunging bridesmaid dress – see wedding photos" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kristen Bell wows in plunging bridesmaid dress – see wedding photos</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kristen Bell shares extremely rare photo of daughters with Dax Shepard" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7fc1c812d977-gettyimages-1127412074.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kristen Bell shares extremely rare photo of daughters with Dax Shepard" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kristen Bell shares extremely rare photo of daughters with Dax Shepard</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c32116e83322-kristen-bell2-z.jpg><p id=eoLhjWEFwSVU data-wc=100>Fans discussed Kristen's parenting detail online, with one person commenting on YouTube: "Alcoholism is often genetic. I wouldn’t get them used to it, but also, my parents let me have a sip of alcoholic beer if I asked throughout my childhood and I’m ok. I thought it was gross, but happy to like be included and trusted or treated as an 'adult' or one of the buddies too. I think everyone should chill." Another person added: "I personally wouldn't do it on principal but a non-alcoholic beer has the same amount of alcohol in it as a kombucha so shrug."&nbsp;</p><p id=exuvZ0c2ZDir data-wc=21>A third person wrote: "If it's not our business, then why is she tellin' everybody?
