Both sisters have had number one albums, mak ing them the first sisters to have achieved this feat.</p><p>Her Creole heritage was passed down to her from her grandparents. Through her mother, Beyoncé is also a descendant of French aristocrats from the southwest of France and Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard. She is also related to slave owners and has distant ancestry that includes Jewish, Spanish, Chinese, and Indonesian roots.</p><p>Growing up, Beyoncé was raised Catholic and attended St. Mary’s Montessori School in Houston, where she took dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when her dance instructor hummed a song and Beyoncé was able to finish it with the ability to hit high notes.</p><p>She went on to win a school talent show at the age of seven by singing “Imagine” by John Lennon. Beyoncé attended a music magnet school in Houston, the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and later Alief Elsik High School. She was also a soloist in the choir at St. John’s United Methodist Church for two years.</p><p>At the age of eight, Beyoncé met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed in a group called Girl’s Tyme with three other girls and performed rap and dance on the talent show circuit in Houston.</p><p>After being noticed by R&B producer Arne Frager, the group was brought to his studio and participated in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Although they didn’t win, Beyoncé’s father resigned from his job to manage the group.</p><p>This decision reduced the family’s income by half, and they had to sell their house and cars and move into separate apartments. The group was eventually signed to Elektra Records and then to Columbia Records, allowing for the reunion of the Knowles family and the recording of their debut album.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beyonce Children: Meet Beyonce’s Children</h2><p>Beyoncé and Jay-Z are the proud parents of three children: Blue Ivy Carter, Rumi Carter, and Sir Carter.
