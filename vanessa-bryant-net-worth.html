She also possessed three villas in Newport Beach after her divorce. Her career also made a significant impact on her property.</p><p>Her late husband died in a helicopter crash in 2020, along with their 13-year-old daughter Gianna. After this catastrophe, she chose to continue her family’s tradition and work to achieve her late husband’s wishes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was Kobe Bryant’s worth?</h2><p>Kobe’s immense fortune was collected primarily through his NBA career, having spent a huge 20 years in the professional game.</p><p>Kobe Bryant, in 2013, invested what is now a measly $5 million in the sports drink brand, BodyArmor, for a 10% stake in the company. It was a startup Kobe believed in at that time to help and back both with his money and his name.&nbsp;</p><p>The brand trusted Kobe as one of its most significant shareholders but had three even bigger ones: Coca-Cola, Keurig Dr. Pepper, and BodyArmor’s founder, Mike Repole. The businessman told Fox <a href=#>Business</a> in May 2020 that without Kobe’s backing, the product, which is near $1 billion in revenue, would have gone nowhere.</p><p>Repole remembered the sports star’s impact on the company and his personal loss to him.</p><p>“<strong>I lost a dear friend. I lost a brother with Kobe and BodyArmor lost a founding father. Kobe Bryant’s fingerprints are all over the BodyArmor brand. The brand wouldn’t be in the position it’s in if Kobe wasn’t a believer back in 2012 and 2013.”</strong></p><p>Without Kobe now, Repole wants to continue BodyArmor with his excellent friend always at the forefront of his mind.</p><p>“<strong>For me, this has always been a journey, the last seven or eight years, with Kobe, and now I feel like this is a journey for Kobe,</strong>” Repole said. “<strong>To me, BodyArmor really is his business legacy. Kobe saw in BodyArmor, when we were under $5 million in sales, what nobody else saw.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Inherited Kobe Bryant’s Fortune?</h2><p>His whole fortune was reportedly inherited by his wife Vanessa and their three remaining children.</p><p>But it soon left its mark as Vanessa became entangled in a legal battle with her mother over finance issues.</p><p>Laine reportedly sued her daughter in December 2020 for a reported $5million, alleging that she worked as an unpaid “<strong>longtime personal assistant and nanny</strong>” to Vanessa and her daughter for years.</p><p>Laine blamed Vanessa for telling her to <strong>“get out</strong>” of the house months after Kobe’s death in January 2020.</p><p>In September 2020, Laine also declared that her daughter ordered her to return a vehicle.</p><p>“<strong>She told me, ‘I need you to get out of this house,</strong>‘” Laine said on Univision’s ‘El Gorda y La Flaca’ show in September.</p><p>“<strong>She also told me that she wanted her car, and she wants it now</strong>.”</p><p>The case was only ended on August 6, 2021, when the LA Times reported that Vanessa had settled a lawsuit against her by her mother.</p><p>According to the outlet, Laine filed a notice of unconditional settlement on August 4 in Orange County Superior Court, suggesting that a request for dismissal would be filed within 45 days.</p><p>However, the terms of the settlement were not released.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vanessa Bryant is Now Becoming Strong for Her Daughters’ Sake</h2><p>Since her husband’s death in January, Vanessa has remained strong for her girls, 17-year-old Natalia, 3-year-old Bianka, and 11-month-old Capri, also known as Koko.</p><p>Us Weekly reported a source close to the Bryant family saying in April 2020 that “<strong>No two days are the same for Vanessa. One day she feels motivated, and the next she’s depressed and needs to take time for herself. … There are moments when it all completely consumes her.</strong>“</p><p>Vanessa has restarted posting images of her girls on her <a href=#>Instagram account</a>. From the photo of Natalia beautifully dressed for her winter formal to Bianka just clowning around, it’s clear Vanessa is doing her best to keep going for her daughters.</p><p><strong>“It’s still unfathomable,”</strong> the source continued. “<strong>It’s the heaviest loss a mother and wife could possibly experience. She’s grieving — and will be for a very long time.</strong>“</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDCwKecrKuRYq%2BzxcCnq2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
