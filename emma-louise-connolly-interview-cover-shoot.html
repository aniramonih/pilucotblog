And I said, ‘Oh my God, no, it’s happening again’.” &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6974eab02733-emma-proudlock-z.jpg><p id=e4QNfguXHkwY data-wc=5><strong>Emma with husband Ollie Proudlock</strong></p><p id=eRIdM8jS2Ic- data-wc=47>Arriving home crestfallen, Ollie met her at their front door. “He said, ‘It doesn’t matter, we’re getting married tomorrow.
