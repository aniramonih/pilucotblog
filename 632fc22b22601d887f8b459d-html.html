"Me and the #1 car had a bit of an issue getting into [turn] one there," Davey Callihan told Race 22.</p><p>Callihan spoke "I felt like I was inside enough there for him to give him a little more room than he did. He kinda pinched me down there and I just didn't give an inch. You gotta fight for your life, for a transfer spot to get in the show."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Callihan was not suprised</h2><p>He elaborated "Unfortunately, we locked tires and it wheel hopped me onto him. It is what it is. Obviously, he wasn't too pumped on it. So, he decided to throw a few shots inside the car."</p><p>"But, that's water under the bridge, we're going to race the ValleyStar 300."</p><p>Andrew Grady has had nothing to say.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqeYrJuRp3xzfJFrZmlxX2eCcIKSa52camKXf3OCj2qbcXBnm4WjgJRym2egpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
