However, Katy’s rack refuses to be tamed and is hanging out there regardless. Not that I’m saying that there’s anything wrong with large boobs (or I’d be speaking out against my own, which already annoy me to no end), but Katy should’ve at least worn a proper bra here. Hell, maybe she actually is wearing a good bra, and this dress just wasn’t made for her body type — it does look like it’s taking quite a strain in the boob area.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3725725.jpg alt title=wenn3725725 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3725737.jpg alt title=wenn3725737 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Katy also paired the blue dress with her preexisting electric blue hair (with faux-dark roots), electric pink lipstick, and too much fake tanner. The overall effect is quite cheap, but that’s the general Katy Perry vibe anyway, so at least she scores some points for consistency.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3727251.jpg alt title=wenn3727251 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Then there was Katy’s performance, which started out with an imitation Perry (so obvious) giving a rendition of “E.T.” before the power went out. Shocking! Of course, the real Katy (if there is one) was dangling far above the stage and prepared to unleash her new single, “Part of Me,” which seemed specifically chosen to point a glaring finger in the direction of one Russell Brand (who was probably at home and either rolling his eyes or doing yoga). This morning, Kaiser and I were discussing the awfulness of Katy’s lyrics, and Kaiser (rightfully) thinks Katy’s playing the post-divorce game by metaphorically shouting, “Sisterhood, I was used by a bad man!” Such a classic pity game. Now because I enjoy <a href=#>making fun of Katy’s lyrics</a>, here are some of the <a href=#>original lyrics to “Part of Me”</a>:</p><p>“You chewed me up and spit me out. Like I was poison in your mouth.</p><p>“Now look at me, I’m sparkling. A firework, a dancing flame. You won’t ever put me out again. I’m glowing, oh woah oh. You can keep the dog from me I never liked him anyway. In fact you can keep everything. Yeah, yeah. Except for me.”</p><p>Except that during this Grammy performance, Katy changed the “dog” line to “So you can keep your diamond ring, it don’t mean nothing anyway.” Yep, this is the chick that signed her divorce papers with <a href=#>a heart and a happy face</a>. Yet I will say that Katy’s body looked pretty amazing onstage:</p><p></p><p>Also and just as a reminder, Russell didn’t take “everything” from Katy except maybe a chunk of her ego, which will bounce back in no time. He certainly <a href=#>didn’t take any of her money</a>, and now TMZ has a new update to that story too:</p><p>Katy Perry and Russell Brand never entertained the idea of signing a prenup — and if they could do it all over again … they wouldn’t have changed a thing, sources close to the couple tell TMZ.</p><p>According to sources, Katy and Russell’s marriage happened so fast, they never really had the opportunity to summon their lawyers and hash out a prenup … nor did either really believe they needed one.</p><p>We’re told both felt comfortable one wouldn’t screw the other in the event of a divorce — they both knew where the other person stood on money, life, religion … everything.</p><p>TMZ broke the story … Russell refused to accept $20 million of Katy’s money he was entitled to as part of the divorce — exactly half the money she made during the course of their marriage.</p><p>Sources tell us, Russell was never a materialistic person and never spent much — he never got into entertainment for the money.</p><p>As one source put it, “Russell is a very simple person who doesn’t need much to make him happy.”</p><p>The source adds, “He would never take money that [Katy] earned. That’s not Russell. And if it was the other way around, Katy wouldn’t have taken it either. They respect each other too much.”</p><p>Where is Hollywood and what have you done with it?!?!</p><p>[From <a href=#>TMZ</a>]</p><p>Isn’t it amusing how both Katy and Russell apparently knew “everything” about each other before marriage except that they were totally wrong for each other as a couple? And let’s not get into “respect” when Katy is clearly trashing Russell at the Grammys. Still, I can buy the part about Russell not being into money, for he even admits that he doesn’t entertain for the cash but for the associated notoriety. As he states in Booky Wook 2, “Without fame my whole persona doesn’t make sense. Without fame my haircut just looks like mental illness.” This totally gels with Russell’s public portrayal of himself; over the weekend, he was even <a href=#>photographed barefoot</a> in the street while walking to his car. Yet he took great care to don one of his dodgy scarves. Priorities, people.</p><p>Now back to Katy and her (probably) teenaged fans:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3727813.jpg alt title=wenn3727813 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3727844.jpg alt title=wenn3727844 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn3727247.jpg alt title=wenn3727247 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2hoZYVye8qaq7KXoJq%2Fs8W%2BoqWYnZyhsqC%2FwJqZmJmklMGpsb6gqZqlna7AoK7EmqytoZaquaC5wK2pqKacrqywvr6tpqiXkqS8o8WO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
