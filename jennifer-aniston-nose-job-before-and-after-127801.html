Just two years after her divorce from <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, Jen was spotted leaving a plastic surgeon’s office in Beverly Hills, which first sparked her nose job rumors.</p><p>Jen underwent plastic surgery to “correct a deviated septum that was incorrectly done over 12 years ago,” her rep told <a href=# title=_self>Us Weekly</a> at the time. Her previous nose job was done before she rose to fame on the hit ’90s sitcom <a href=# title=_self>Friends</a>.

Best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years,” she admitted later that year. Shortly after word of her new nose job got out, <a href=# title=_self>TMZ</a> reported that Jen accused her surgeon of leaking the information to the press — but Dr. Raj Kanodia, who has also performed rhinoplasties on singer Ashlee Simpson and actress Cameron Diaz, denied those allegations.</p><p>But since coming clean, Jen can even laugh and make jokes about her plastic surgery. During an episode of <a href=# title=_self>Inside the Actors Studio</a>, she opened up about an incident that happened during her high school days on the softball team where a ball came flying towards the bench where she was sitting and hit her in the face, breaking her nose. “That’s a broken nose?” host James Lipton asked, and Jen quipped, “Sort of — not anymore.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jnKemmZuys3nAp6CsrJ%2Bjeq%2B70p5ko6eSYq%2Bmss6rnGaZnpl6orLTnqlmaWJshXF9jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
