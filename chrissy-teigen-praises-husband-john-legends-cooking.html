Though she has two cookbooks to her name – Cravings and Cravings: Hungry For More, which comes out on Tuesday, September 18 – the star says her husband John Legend is becoming quite the skilled cook.</p><p>“John’s an amazing cook. He cooked seven days a week while I was pregnant,” Teigen told <a href=#>Bon Appétit</a>. “He was always my sous; he loves to chop things.”</p><p>And unlike some beginner cooks Teigen says her EGOT-winning husband has a knack for picking up skills in the kitchen. “You teach him one thing and he remembers it forever. Now he’s become a chef in his own right,” the star continued. “I’m like, you’re really trying to take my title in the house! He’s become so good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, Teigen arguably reigns supreme when it comes to whipping up a delicious meal. Her first cookbook quickly became a New York Times Bestseller, and the Lip Sync Battle cohost says the recipes in latest effort are even more bold and flavorful. “[From the first book] I didn’t think anyone would stuff ground pork into a cucumber and boil it with chicken broth. But they did, and they loved the flavors and I thought that was so cool,” she explained to the outlet. “So we were ballsier about the Thai chapter in Hungry For More. This one is definitely more extensive and not as traditional. We do have a pad thai carbonara, but also you’re going into food from my mom’s village days.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Chrissy-Teigen-Reveals-John-Legend-Cooked-For-Her-Seven-Days-a-Week-While-She-Was-Pregnant-02.jpg><p>In addition to some more complicated recipes, Teigen noted Hungry For More also includes simple dishes that she and her family love. “There’s a recipe for Thai fried ribs that I was hesitant to put in because it has three ingredients. It’s literally soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and [baby back] ribs, but it’s so delicious,” she dished. “My daughter loves it, and we all love it. You try something like that and you say, ‘no, this, this has to be in.’” The couple are parents of daughter Luna, 2, and son Miles, 4 months.</p><p>And even though Teigen, 32, was wary of including something so simple in the book, she was reminded of how readers love the quick and easy recipe for cacio e pepe, which quickly became a Cravings favorite. Added the star: “You have to be comfortable with putting easier things in the book.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerG%2BwKKqnqtdncK0rsCnm2ain527brjEoJynnKNisLC7yqKloGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
