The two had been married for almost 3 decades before divorcing in December of 2018. And Caputo admits to mourne the end of her marriage with Larry Caputo.</p><p>Also, read about&nbsp;<a href=#>Theresa Caputo is getting a divorce from estranged husband Larry Caputo after 28 years of their marriage!

She said,</p><p>“I do, but I don’t. I miss what once was. I’m grieving right now. I’m grieving my 30, almost 34 years, with Larry. This is a grieving process, but things weren’t the same that they were 34 years ago. So, of course, I miss that aspect. But the way that things were at the end, no — I don’t miss that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Theresa-Caputo-admits-to-still-be-grieving-over-herhhh-borken-marriage-.jpg><p>The two formal couple were married for 28 years, before announcing their split back in 2017. They share two children together who have both appeared in the show: Larry Caputo Jr and Victoria Caputo. After about a year, the two officially divorced in December of 2018.</p><p>Since then, Larry has been dating new people and moving on from his past however, Caputo doesn’t seem to cope much well. When asked about this matter Caputo assured everyone that she was very happy for her ex-husband. She said,</p><p>“At the end of the day, that’s what we want out of life, is for us to be happy and to live our best lives. We always have to love, honor and respect ourselves. We’re both doing that and respecting each other in the same token. So you can’t ask for anything more.”</p><p>Theresa and Larry both had told US Magazine during their split that they would always be loving each other. And maybe being happy for Larry now that he found someone new is Caputo’s way of still loving him. We also hope that Caputo can find someone new for herself or just find something new that provides her with joy and happiness.</p><p>Also, read about&nbsp;<a href=#>Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott dating!

However, Caputo doesn’t really feel like she needs to find someone new fast, she says that she is content at the moment with her life, which is totally fine as well. Happiness is not always being with someone sometimes you should be with yourself and feel happy as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Theresa-Caputo-with-ex-husband-Larry-Caputo.jpg><p>The 53-year-old had married very early on in her life and she had been with Larry forever as far as she could remember so, it must be quite hard for her to adjust to a new life but assures everyone that she is quite content with things.</p><p>According to a close source to Caputo,</p><p>“Theresa got married at a really young age and hasn’t really experienced life outside of Larry [and] being married. Theresa is now living life and exploring solo … she’s figuring herself [out] and it’s a whole world of adventure.”</p><p>Also when asked if she would try dating or even marry again Caputo answered,</p><p>“I never thought of it, and I have to say I don’t know. Right now, I would have to say no. I’m very content where I am in my life. I’m very blessed. Do I want to have someone to share companionship with and to have someone? Absolutely. But, to actually get married, I don’t know.”</p><p>Also, read about it&nbsp;<a href=#>Audrina Patridge is in a romantic relationship with Josh Henderson after her divorce!</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_Bio_on_Theresa_Caputo></span>Short Bio on Theresa Caputo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Theresa Caputo</a> is a well-known celebrity&nbsp;and American television personality.
