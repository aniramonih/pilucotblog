Right around the time she was nominated for her Oscar, she was in the process of leaving Gene Kelly, whom she first met at age 16 — a girl next door dancing her heart out to make it onto a chorus line.</p><p>Had she not met Kelly, then a 28-year-old choreographer who fought to get her cast in a nightclub revue, maybe Blair would have attended Sarah Lawrence, where she was already accepted. She might have married a doctor, choreographed the high-school senior show and worried about things like stains on the carpet and commutes. But she did meet Kelly and lived instead the life that housewives and young girls alike paid money to inhabit, via the silver screen, for two hours at a time. First Kelly whisked his bookish, bright-eyed ingenue around New York, taking her to museums, Village jazz clubs, Polish dance halls and the Rainbow Room, buying her chocolate sodas late at night as he and his left-leaning friends talked politics around the table. Then, as his star rose, he whisked her all the way to Hollywood. At their home on Rodeo Drive, Blair, a mother at 18, entertained talents like Arthur Laurents and André Previn and stars like Lena Horne and Noël Coward at regular Saturday gatherings. Starlets, playwrights and legends played competitive games of volleyball and charades when they weren’t introducing new songs or listening to Judy Garland solos. Blair was no great singer, which didn’t stop her from belting out tunes around the piano; she wasn’t beautiful, which didn’t stop her from becoming a seductive flirt. What, precisely, was the nature of her charm? “She was joyous,” Leslie Caron, who fondly recalls those Saturday nights in her autobiography, “Thank Heaven,” told me.

He was then snapped up by MGM and I believe they held the film rights to Pal Joey but dawdled about making the film, perhaps because the hero was too unsympathetic. But I would have thought thought that Kelly would have had enough power at MGM by the early 50s to finally get it made...but maybe even he didn't want to play an anti-hero by then. Which is a shame because the film that was eventually made with Sinatra in 1957 was lousy.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 151</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 24, 2022 1:45 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I can forgive him for this alone</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 153</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 24, 2022 1:53 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>He plays a dramatic role in "Christmas Holiday", which is really a misleading title for a film noir with a few songs, opposite Deanna Durbin, in a role that suggests the kind of heel Pal Joey was.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 154</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 24, 2022 1:58 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>R145, She gives Kelly the credit for EVERYTHING in his films.
