They met in 2000 when she was working in the real estate industry, and married in 2007. At the start of her marriage everything was fine, but after three years of marriage, they filed for divorce, and went their separate ways peacefully, with Jennifer getting half of the property they earned while they were married. After the divorce, it didn’t take her long to find a new boyfriend – Cisco Rosado who is an actor, but this relationship didn’t last long, as they broke up in 2014.</p><h2><span id=Drama_with_her_ex-boyfriend>Drama with her ex-boyfriend</span></h2><p>After her previous two failed relationships, she met Tim Norman, the star of “Sweetie Pies”. She hoped that he was the one for her, but little did she know that it would turn out to be an awful experience for her. It went from a perfect relationship at start to her calling her lawyer to file a domestic violence charge against Tim. In an interview she gave she said: ‘I have not been with him for three months, he’s been blocked from both of my phones, all of my social media. I’ve moved on in another relationship and been living my life in L.A.’ She was convinced that he got the message that it was over between them. However, he turned out to be a stalker who didn’t want to leave her alone: ‘At one point he did have a set of keys to my place, so I was like did he get a copy of my key made? I turn around, I see him parked by the side of the road. He followed me, so I dipped off and went to my friend’s house.’ This case went to a court and Tim had been given a 150ft restraining order that he cannot violate or he will be facing jail time.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Net_worth>Net worth</span></h2><p>According to authoritative sources, Jennifer’s net worth is around $25 million, a lot coming from the two businesses she owns, but around $350,000 from the reality show “Basketball Wives”, and no doubt a sizeable amount from her divorce. As she possesses amazing entrepreneur skills, she is set to make a lot more money. Her business is blooming and her net worth is just going to keep climbing.</p><h2><span id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h2><p>Because she is the owner of a fashion boutique, she certainly knows how to dress. When she makes an appearance, she likes to look stylish and fashionable. Most of the things that she wears are from her own shop. She is 5ft 9ins (1.75 m) tall, has black long hair and blue eyes that go well with her skin color, and make her look exotic.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Coming soon to Classy Girl Wardrobe ? <a rel=nofollow href=#>#AllThingsClassy</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/FTs1Jy28fS</a></p><p>— Jennifer Williams (@iamjennifer) <a rel=nofollow href=#>June 9, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Jennifer likes to enjoy life as much as she can, or as much as her obligations allow her.
