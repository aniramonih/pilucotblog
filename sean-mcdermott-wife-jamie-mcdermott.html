For instance, he guided the team to their first playoffs in eighteen years and helped them clinch the AFC East Division Title consecutively in 2020 and 2021.</p><p>As McDermott is gaining much success career wise, he is always in the spotlight. So, itâ€™s natural for his family to also be on the media radar. Moreover, the NFL coach is a married man, and people are interested to know about the woman behind his heart.</p><p>Sean McDermottâ€™s wife,&nbsp;<strong>Jamie McDermott,&nbsp;</strong>is a gorgeous lady who always supports his NFL career. But, unlike other celebrity wives, she prefers to stay away from the limelight.</p><p>Did you know that the pair were college sweethearts? If not, letâ€™s learn more about Sean McDermottâ€™s spouse, Jamie, in this article.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sean_And_Jamie_Are_College_Sweethearts></span>Sean And Jamie Are College Sweethearts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Jamie came into the spotlight due to her relationship with the NFL head coach. But, she is a private person and hasnâ€™t shared information about her background and family. Still, as per several sources, Jamie was born on June 25, 1979. If this is true then Jamie is five years younger than her husband.</p><p>Those familiar with Sean will know that he was initially a footballer at&nbsp;La Salle College High School. He played quarterback and safeties there. However, the NFL coach not only got his start in football but also met his life partner in school.</p><p>The pair developed a romantic connection while attending La Salle together. Although young, both must have been serious about their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sean-McDermott-And-His-Wife-Jamie-McDermott-Are-CollegeSweethearts.jpg><p>The coupleâ€™s puppy love turned into something more over time. Both parties were dating while Sean enrolled at the College of William and Mary and played collegiate football. Moreover, Sean McDermottâ€™s then-girlfriend, Jamie, must have supported his football passion and likely never missed out on any of his matches.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Had_An_Intimate_Wedding></span>Had An Intimate Wedding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Most people expect famous personalities to hold a grand wedding ceremony. It might be true for some, but it doesnâ€™t apply to the Buffalo Bills head coach. He didnâ€™t have a lavish wedding party on his big day.</p><p>The lovebirds havenâ€™t precisely shared when they got married. Both likely wed on an intimate event with family and friends present. Likewise, McDermott hasnâ€™t shared any of his wedding pictures with the media.</p><p>Stil, bride, and groom must have enjoyed their ceremony.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jamie_McDermott_Is_A_Mother_Of_Three></span>Jamie McDermott Is A Mother Of Three<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jamie has been married to her husband, Sean, for several years and in their marital life, they have welcomed three lovely children. Jamie McDermottâ€™s eldest daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Madeline McDermott,&nbsp;</strong>aka&nbsp;<strong>Maddie McDermott, </strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">was born</a> in 2009. She has had an allergy to nuts and tree nuts since her birth. In addition, she carries an EpiPen at all times in case of accidental exposure.</p><p>Two years after welcoming their firstborn, Sean McDermottâ€™s wife gave birth to their son, <strong>Gavin McDermott</strong>. Sadly, he is also food allergic and has a sesame allergy.</p><p>The pair welcomed their youngest child, <strong>Kelly McDermott,&nbsp;</strong>in 2015. The latter is the apple of her parentâ€™s eyes and is loved by her siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jamie-McDermott-is-a-mother-of-three.jpg><p>Jamieâ€™s kids often attend their father Seanâ€™s matches to show their support. The coach has also fondly spoken of how his children inspire him to work harder. Furthermore, the duoâ€™s babies joined their dad on his Good Morning Football&nbsp;interview in 2020 and the family immediately trended all over social media.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sean_McDermotts_Wife_Is_Involved_In_Charitable_Works></span>Sean McDermottâ€™s Wife Is Involved In Charitable Works<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the Bills head coachâ€™s spouse, Jamie, leads a quiet life away from media scrutiny. She doesnâ€™t seem forthcoming to share her personal details. Still, her impressive charitable efforts have made several headlines.</p><p>Sean McDermottâ€™s wife has shown interest in helping many foundations and non-profit organizations. For instance, Jamie teamed up with her partner, Sean, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">to match</a> fan donations of $20,000 for&nbsp;Give716&nbsp;in July 2021.</p><p>The couple has also joined forces to promote food allergy awareness. Both have experienced firsthand how food allergies affect young children. So, the pairâ€™s motive is to educate other parents regarding this issue.</p><p>The McDermotts often visit childrenâ€™s hospitals and provide gifts to the patients. For instance, both have paid visits to John R. Oishei Childrenâ€™s Hospital&nbsp;several times and interacted with the children and family members.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The McDermott Family made some new friends at <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@OCHBuffalo</a> today! ðŸ¤— <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#OneBuffalo</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yOj9ZaFSQw</a></p><p>â€” Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2019</a></p><p>The young patients are undoubtedly happy to see the new faces.
