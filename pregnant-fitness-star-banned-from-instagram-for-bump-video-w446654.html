After taking a break from workouts due to morning sickness, she decided to return to Instagram with a video showing one of her weight-lifting routines during pregnancy.</p><p>“Yes I am Biggg and Well Aware … but to be honest I truly do not care. I have debated sharing this video of my big bare belly in full workout mode because of body shaming comments that I am sure will come,” she originally captioned the <a href=#>October 19 post</a> in which she exercises in a sports bra and leggings. “Ultimately, this wasn’t a great enough reason to keep me from sharing and empowering women to love their bodies through each stage of their fitness journeys. Six pack or big belly I still hustle”</p><p>Although the video didn’t violate any of Instagram’s community guidelines and was intended to empower women, her account was temporarily disabled. Perille Yobe shared a message she received from the photo-sharing app with Cosmopolitan.com, which explained that they “disable accounts that post content that is sexually suggestive or contains nudity.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The southern California-based mom-to-be, whose many booty workouts could arguably be perceived as much more sexual than her bare belly, expressed her frustrations that she was penalized. "All I was doing in the video was working out like I’d done in all the other workout videos I have posted for years. There was nothing out of the ordinary in this one besides my bump,” she told Cosmopolitan.com. “I am certain I am not the only woman who has been shut down for posting pictures and videos of a child growing inside my belly.”</p><p>Perille Yobe appealed the ban to Instagram and her account was reinstated on Tuesday, October 25.
