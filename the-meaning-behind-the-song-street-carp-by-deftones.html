The song is written from the perspective of lead singer Chino Moreno, and it revolves around encountering someone from his past, possibly an ex-girlfriend or a former fling.</p><p>In the first verse, Chino describes the person as a girl with sharp teeth, someone who is aggressive and destructive. He acknowledges that he doesn’t truly care about her, but her presence in his life has been troublesome.</p><p>Chorus 1 introduces a new address, a symbolic representation of Chino’s attempt to distance himself from this person and move on. The numbers mentioned, such as “6-6-4,” serve as a metaphorical hiding place, highlighting his desire to remain hidden from her.</p><p>Verse 2 continues to explore the theme of detachment and frustration. Chino refers to the girl having gold teeth, which could symbolize someone who is superficial and materialistic. He emphasizes her inability to calm down and the ongoing conflicts that arise whenever she is around.</p><p>Chorus 2 reintroduces another address, “6-1-5,” further emphasizing Chino’s reluctance to fully reconnect with her. He acknowledges that there is evidence of their past, but he implores her to take it home and leave him alone.</p><p>The bridge section of the song repeats the phrase “Now, write it down” multiple times, as if emphasizing the importance of documenting this encounter. Chino questions whether she truly understands and comprehends the situation.</p><p>Chorus 3 brings forth yet another address, “6-6-5,” as Chino confesses his frustration and the cycle of their interactions. He encourages her to take the evidence and play games with it, indicating his exhaustion and desire for her to leave.</p><p>The song concludes with the repetitive “Now, so write it down” lines, as Chino questions if she truly understands the gravity of their encounters.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Interpretation></span>The Interpretation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Street Carp explores themes of frustration, resentment, and the desire to break free from someone’s toxic influence. Chino Moreno’s lyrics paint a picture of someone who is haunted by the memories and presence of a destructive relationship.</p><p>The title itself, “Street Carp,” adds another layer of meaning. A carp is an undesirable fish, and in this context, it could symbolize a promiscuous or manipulative person. The “Street Carp” is someone Chino once associated with, but now wants to distance himself from due to their destructive qualities.</p><p>As listeners, we can relate to the feelings of wanting to sever ties with someone who brings negativity into our lives. The recurring theme of changing addresses implies an ongoing battle to keep this person away and establish new boundaries.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Connection></span>Personal Connection<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Street Carp holds a personal significance for me. This song reminds me of a time when I had to distance myself from a toxic relationship. The lyrics resonated deeply with me, as I found solace in Chino’s frustration and the acknowledgment that it’s okay to cut ties with people who only bring us down.</p><p>Moreover, the intense energy and aggression of the song provided an outlet for my own feelings of anger and resentment. It served as a cathartic experience and allowed me to let go of the negativity that burdened me.</p><p>Listening to Street Carp also brings back vivid memories of concerts and road trips with friends, where we would play this song at full volume and scream the lyrics together. It became an anthem of rebellion and empowerment for us, solidifying our bond and shared experiences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Credits></span>Credits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Street Carp was produced by Terry Date and Deftones, and written by Chi Cheng, Abe Cunningham, Chino Moreno, and Stephen Carpenter.
