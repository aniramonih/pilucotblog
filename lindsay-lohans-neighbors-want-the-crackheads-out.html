Thieves took everything from doors (seriously) to jewelry, clothes and shoes. Here’s what surprised me the most – Lindsay doesn’t live in any kind of gated community, as most reasonably famous actors in Los Angeles do. Lindsay just lives in a regular old neighborhood, with nothing in the way of exclusive security. Granted, it’s probably a pretty ritzy neighborhood. But that seems to a double-edged sword – Radar is reporting that Lindsay’s neighbors want her out. They’re tired of the paparazzi, the burglaries, the insanity that follows the continuing cracked-out adventures of Lindsay Lohan. Unfortunately for the neighbors, unless they pool their money together to buy Lindsay a home in a gated community, I don’t she’s going to be moving out any time soon:</p><p>This time Lindsay Lohan’s latest controversy isn’t even her fault. Some of the actress’s neighbors want her to move out of their Hollywood Hills enclave due to all the paparazzi and recent robberies, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively.</p><p>“The truth is that this is a very quiet neighborhood and there have been no break-ins apart from at Lindsay Lohan’s house,” a neighbor told RadarOnline.com. “Since she moved in last November it has been a nightmare with all the paparazzi parking in our driveways waiting for her.”</p><p>The star was targeted for a second time at her rented home after thieves made off with a safe, bags, jewelry and shoes belonging to the actress. The first robbery was reported in May and the latest one occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning. Detectives at the Hollywood police station are currently reviewing video footage which reportedly caught three men leaving the house.</p><p>“It’s obviously an inside job and I first noticed that the door at the side of the property was missing a few days ago.”</p><p>Her father Michael Lohan told RadarOnline.com on Monday that he was determined to find the culprits. Unfortunately, that may be too little too late for the current residents of the hip area which counts Ryan Gosling and Vince Vaughn as homeowners.</p><p>“This is a really narrow and winding street and I’m amazed there has not been a more serious accident,” the neighbor added. “I’ve got nothing personal against her but she needs to find a home in a gated community with security at the main gate because all the residents are fed-up with the situation.”</p><p>On Monday, the house lay empty with no padlocks on the main door and with the side door missing after it had been ripped of its hinges. Lohan left the home on Sunday with three friends and a personal assistant was also seen loading-up some personal possessions into a car.</p><p>[From<a href=#> Radar</a>]</p><p>My first thought was actually “Oh, God, how does Lindsay still make enough money to still rent a home in the Hollywood Hills?” Doesn’t it seem like Lindsay has been “living off the crackhead land” for a while now, and that she’s basically been living off of Samantha Ronson specifically? Perhaps Lindsay could just barely afford to keep her home, and that’s why she couldn’t afford even a basic security system. But I do think the neighbors have it right – it sounds like an inside job. Probably one of Lindsay’s dealers.</p><p>Lindsay is shown outside her home on 8/24/09.
