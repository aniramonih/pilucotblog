Since season 2 of <a href=#>Emily in Paris</a> was released last week, fans<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>— and fashion critics — have been buzzing about the style on the show.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>From Emily Cooper’s [<a href=#><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>] cliché and over-the-top ensembles to Camille’s [<a href=#><strong>Camille Razat</strong></a>] effortless attire, costume designer <strong>Patricia Fields</strong> made sure to serve up dozens of jaw-dropping looks in just 10 episodes.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While there were unquestionably some <a href=#>obsession-worthy fashion moments</a> (peep Collins’ red Giambattista Valli gown in the series finale), others found themselves leaning a bit outrageous, drawing criticism for their kitschy prints and very un-French vibes.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But rest assured, the decision to have Cooper running around in crazy sunglasses, heart-motif dresses and headpieces galore was very intentional.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Fields revealed in a letter penned for InStyle in October that she set out to emphasize the fact that Cooper is, at heart, a Midwestern girl.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Emily is an optimist and she would be very excited to be an American in Paris,” she wrote. “So to me, it just made sense that she would put on a blouse that had the Eiffel Tower on it or carry a Mona Lisa bag or throw on a beret.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>She added: “Her style was intentionally clichéd, but it was also cheerful and whimsical and allowed her to fully express her enthusiasm for being there.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While Emily’s fashion remained the same more or less, her beauty looks did have a bit of an evolution. Makeup artist <strong>Aurélie Payen</strong> exclusively told Us that she decided to go a bit<a href=#> “more French” when it came to glam for season two</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For instance, she used matte lipsticks and berry hues a bit less than in the first season, giving her lighter makeup (on occasion!) for the second go round.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>“I wanted to still stay focused on Emily’s personality, but add a tiny bit of French makeup and French style into her character,” she told Us. “[She’s] French inspired, but still her. Still the Emily that we know and love.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Countering Emily’s style was Camille, who undeniably has that French je ne sai quoi. Costume designer <strong>Marylin Fitoussi</strong>, who worked alongside Fields, told Fashionista that she intentionally dressed the actress in “very strong” and “avant-garde” silhouettes that were black or white in color to contrast Emily’s out-there outfits.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>To see the wildest and most amazing beauty and fashion from Emily, Mindy and Camille on season two, keep scrolling.
