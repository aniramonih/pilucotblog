If all the speculation of Ian Somerhalder leaving ‘The Vampire Diaries’ is true, it’s going to take more than a few wedding photos to distract TVD fans from Damon Salvatore’s departure.</p><p>Ian and Nikki are not shy when it comes to their romance. ET bills the wedding as “fairytale” which fits in with the supernatural theme of Somerhalder’s CW show, but there isn’t much of magical enchantment of their story. The two met courtesy of Ian’s now former costar and then girlfriend, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nina Dobrev, who Ian had been dating since 2011</a>. Nikki was married to American Idol alum, Paul McDonald, but that didn’t stop a friendship from growing into romance. Somerhalder and Dobrev split after 3 years of dating, and Ian and Nikki announced their engagement just a few weeks after Nikki Reed’s divorce was finalized. Nina dismissed rumors of bad blood between herself and Nikki, but it’s evident that<a rel=nofollow href=#> there were some hard feeling between the former friends</a>.</p><p>Nina Dobrev left ‘The Vampire Diaries’ much to the dismay of fans who love the show. The next season of TVD seems to be up in the air. Producers and the cast have teased the possible return of Elena, but Nina has shut down the rumors insisting she is done with the role during her speech at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.</p><p>As CDL covered, Ian has been posting some cryptic messages via his Instagram account hinting at his possible departure from ‘The Vampire Diaries’ as he is looking happily toward “the future.” In an interview with TV Guide, Ian doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in recreating the chemistry Nina brought as Elena saying, “Elena even told him, ‘Go live your life!’ — i.e. get into some panties, do whatever you need to do, and enjoy it. I don’t think he’s quite there, [but] any woman coming into the fray has to be so unbelievably bad ass that the audience loves this person first because it’ll be trouble. The fandom is extremely opinionated. They’re very set on this Elena-Damon dynamic, so I wish all the best of luck in the world to whoever that is.”</p><p>It will have to be when I get back from meeting. Grace is reading at a Kindergarten level, so I have to go sign her up for a reading support group.</p><p>Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG5nmZa7br%2FOppyroJGhsaa%2BjKqsoqyknruoedOhnGaukaK9qr7EZpuimaKesrR5y6KinmWenruiecOomaudpmLAqa3RnqpmppmguKp50Z6cnWWnmrGltc2gZKmgn6m8tHnTqGScp6aav27Bz2arr5xdmsWqwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
