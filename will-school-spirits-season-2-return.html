But a few things could show where the show is going. Fans of School Spirits can take heart from how many people watch the show.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since the first season, the show has been in the top ten most-watched shows on Netflix. This means that there are a lot of fans of the show who want to see more of the story. Also, the cast and team of School Spirits have said they want to keep going with the story after the first season.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Fans looking forward to the next part of the show’s story may be frustrated by the lack of news, but it is not unusual for streaming services to choose whether to give a show another season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pabaon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/School-Spirits-Season-2-2.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>They have talked about how excited they are to learn more about the show’s characters and world, which could mean they are already planning a second season.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But some things could stop School Spirits from returning for a second season. One of the most complex problems could be scheduling problems with the cast and crew, who may be working on other projects or have other duties that make it hard to film a new season.</p><h2 id=what-can-we-expect-from-school-spirits-season-2 class=rb-heading-index-2>What Can We Expect From School Spirits Season 2?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>It’s hard to say what season 2 of School Spirits will be about. Since only a few first-season scenes have been shown so far, it is hard to tell how the story will go. Maddie could keep looking into how she died in Season 2, or a new account could start.</p><h2 id=school-spirits-season-1-ending-explained class="rb-heading-index-3 heading_title">School Spirits Season 1 Ending Explained</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The fact that Maddie was genuinely alive but not in control of her body was one of the significant revelations at the end of Season 1. Maddie witnessed an argument that led to Janet possessing Maddie after she had hidden in the boiler room and overheard it. This realization also clarifies Maddie’s desire to speak with the living.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although there were several rumors about Janet, the circumstances of her death and incapacity to cross over were revealed in the meantime. Additionally, Mr. Martin confesses that he, too, perished in a fire, though his reasons for not wanting to relive it are still a little hazy, opening up a promising direction for Season 2.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The planned graphic novel of the same name by Megan and Nate Trinrud’s siblings inspired the film School Spirits, which they also executive produced. The show’s first season has ended, but the graphic novel won’t be available until November 14. Max Winkler, Oran Zegman, Brian Dannelly, and Hannah Macpherson are among the series’ directors.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Bridgerton and Oliver Goldstick, the showrunner and executive producer of Pretty Little Liars, executive produced with Winkler, Don Dunn, and Joyce Sawa. Kristian Flores, Milo Manheim, Kiara Pichardo, Sarah Yarkin, Spencer MacPherson, Nick Pugliese, Rainbow Wedell, and Alison Thornton are just a few of the actors in the cast.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Shauna Phelan, Executive VP and Co-Head of Nickelodeon and Awesomeness live-action explained to THR about the renewal:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“We saw how engaged the show’s fans were, and we’re excited about not only the creative direction of the show [in season one] but the promise of the creative direction we’re aware of in the second season. The audience responding to the show so positively and so passionately made it an easy call for us.
